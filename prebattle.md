# PRE-BATTLE SEQUENCE

This is the Pre-Battle sequence, to be followed for every battle, after all participants have been determined.

# 1. DETERMINE SCENARIO

If this battle is over a territory, roll on the following table to determine the scenario played:

| Roll  | Result         |
|-------|----------------|
| 2-3   | [Gang Moot](scenarios.md#scenGangMoot)     |
| 4-5   | [The Trap](scenarios.md#scenTheTrap)   |
| 6-8   | [Stand-Off](scenarios.md#scenStandOff)    |
| 9-10  | [Ambush!](scenarios.md#scenAmbush)      |
| 11-12 | [Escort Mission](scenarios.md#scenEscortMission) |

 otherwise, the scenario is dictated by the reason for battle.
 
# 2. ATTACKERS AND DEFENDERS

If this battle is being fought over unclaimed territory, the Knife (the player who selected the territory) is the Defender. If this is being fought over a claimed territory, the player who currently controls that Territory is the Defender. All other players are Attackers. Otherwise, roles will be determined by the scenario type. 

This doesn't mean that all Attackers are allies, just that they all follow the Attacker rules for deployment and scoring!
 
# 3. HOME TURF

If this battle is being fought over territory already claimed by a gang, that gang receives the Home Turf advantage: they roll bottle checks twice and use the better result, and add 1 to the result of any Rally test.
 
# 4. SET UP THE BATTLEFIELD

If players wish, roll 2D6 to determine a Terrain Style: 

| Roll  | Result        |
|-------|---------------|
| 2-4   | Towers        |
| 5-7   | Slums         |
| 8-9   | Zone Mortalis |
| 10-11 | Sump Sea      |

Unless otherwise specified by the scenario, players take turns placing large terrain elements, then vertical mobility terrain (stairs, ladders, etc), then scatter terrain, then special terrain per the scenario rules.

# 5. TERRITORY BOONS

Players announce any Territory Boons they have available to them in the coming battle.
 
# 6. TACTICS CARDS

Unless otherwise specified in the scenario rules, players draw two Tactics Cards (three during Takeover) to use for this battle from their Tactics deck. Players add any Underdog cards they have access to to their hand of Tactics cards.

# 7. CHOOSE STARTING CREWS

Depending on the scenario and your gang's role (Attacker or Defender), you may choose your starting crew one of two ways: 

## RANDOM SELECTION (X)

Shuffle together fighter cards for all fighters who are not Captive, in Recovery, or have some other status that would prevent them from fighting this battle. Draw up to X cards. This is the starting crew for the battle. 

## CUSTOM SELECTION (X)
-- Pick up to X fighters from your gang who are not Captive, in Recovery, or have some other status that would prevent them from fighting in this battle. If there is no X specified, treat X as the number of fighters in your gang.

# 8. HIRED GUNS :id=hiredguns

If they wish, players may hire any available Hired Guns. First the Defender, then all Attackers in order of smallest starting crew to largest, may select one or more Hired Guns from those available. Players pay **half the cost** of the selected fighters from their Stash Credits, and add that fighter to their Starting Crew. If multiple players with the same crew size wish to hire fighters, roll off to see who goes first.

For the duration of the battle, Hired Guns are treated as a member of the gang for most purposes, with the following exceptions:

- Hired Guns may not be taken captive, nor are they counted when determining if any captives were taken.

Once hired, a Hired Gun's fighter card is not returned to the pool of available Hired Guns until it's drawn again at the start of a new week.

# 9. RECOVERY

If any gangs participating in this battle have fighters in **Recovery**, those fighters lose the status. Those fighters still may not take part in this battle, but clearing Recovery now saves bookkeeping at the end of the battle - there's no need to track which fighters went into recovery during this battle, vs which fighters were already in recovery at the battle's start.

If *every fighter* from a gang is in Recovery, up to three fighters from that gang may participate in this battle. They start the fight with one Flesh Wound, and automatically go back into Recovery once the battle is over, in addition to any other results from any Permanent Injury rolls made for the fighter.

# 10. DEPLOYMENT

Unless the scenario specifies otherwise, all gangs roll off to pick their deployment zone: a corner of the map, or if there are more than 4 players, a series of roughly equidistant points along the edge of the map. If a deployment zone would be inaccessible to the rest of the map (this may be an issue with some Zone Mortalis setups), move it directly towards the center until it's no longer cut off. Players then take turns, rolling off to determine order, placing their fighters inside their deployment zone.

# 11. ENFORCER CHECK

If any gang participating in the battle is in **Debt,** there's a chance the Enforcers will show up! At the start of each round roll to see if Enforcers show up, as described in the [Enforcer rules.](enforcers.md)
