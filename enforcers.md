# THE ENFORCERS :id=enforcerTop

Enforcers don't much mind gang activity on their turf - they mind not getting their cut. If any player is unable (or unwilling!) to pay their "taxes" during the campaign, the Enforcers might pay them a visit during their next battle!

If a player starts a battle **in debt** to the Enforcers, roll 1d6 every round after the first, before placing ready markers. If more than one gang participating in the battle is in Debt, subtract 1 from the roll for each additional gang in Debt. 

On a two or less the Enforcers show up!

# SETUP

The player(s) who owes a debt is the "Debtor". Players who do not owe are "Compliant".

This is not intended to be a fair, balanced fight - the Enforcers want to make an example of what happens when you don't pay up.

A player not taking part in the fight will control the Enforcer gang. They will draw 8+D3 random Enforcer fighter cards, and set them up with 2 inches of any edge of the battlefield, at least 8 inches from Debtor fighters.

# OBJECTIVE

The Enforcer's objective is to kill or capture as many fighters of the gang that didn't pay up as possible! The Enforcer player cannot directly target Compliant fighters, but may hit Compliant fighters with template weapons or stray shots - Enforcers don't care much about collateral damage.

If at any time a fighter from a Compliant gang causes an Enforcer player to be wounded - even accidentally, such as with a scattered grenade - they will immediately have 40 credits added to their debt and resolve the scenario as though they were a Debtor!

# ARRESTS

Enforcers will sometimes use "less-lethal" force. When an Enforcer directly causes a fighter they're in base-to-base contact with to be Seriously Injured or Out of Action, roll 1d6. On a 2 or lower, that fighter is immediately arrested and taken captive by the Enforcers, and other actions (like the Permanent Injury roll) are skipped.

# THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY

Any time after the Enforcers are deployed, other gangs taking part in the battle may choose to help the Debtor in their battle against the Enforcers. If they do, and the Debtor player agrees, then both gangs enter a Formal Alliance that lasts the duration of the battle: 
â€‹ 
1. The allied gangs may not directly target each other for attacks, and may move through each other's models as through they're friendly. Friendly Fire is still possible with template weapons, stray shots, and other indirect ways of dealing wounds. Additionally, fighters from the other gang count as friendly for Interference.
2. Enforcers may now target the other gang as though they're debtors.
3. If the players are victorious, they will split the loot evenly (see "I FOUGHT THE LAW AND I WON").
4. If the players are not victorious, they will receive no rewards for the scenario. The player(s) that started the battle Compliant will immediately increase their debt by 1D6 X 3 for each Enforcer that was Seriously Injured or Out of Action when they left the battle, then they will need to follow the same End rules as the debtor gang!
5. If one gang involuntarily bottles out, and the other gang wins the fight, both gangs will count as having won. If a gang chooses to bottle out, they are breaking the alliance and will get no share of the bounty if the other wins!

# I FOUGHT THE LAW AND...

Regardless of the outcome, all Debtor (and Compliant ally) fighters who participated in the battle receive 1D3 experience, on top of the usual participation XP.

# ...THE LAW WON :id=lawwon
If the debtor gang is eliminated from the board (including via bottling out), increase their existing debt by 1d6 x 4 for each Enforcer fighter Seriously Injured or Out of Action. This total will be added to this battle's Territory debt, calculated as usual. If they fully pay off this debt in the post-battle, the Enforcers will not bother them any more.

They may now also reduce their debt by paying in blood: a gang can give any non-Leader fighter (with their equipment) to the Enforcers and reduce their debt by that fighter's credit value (debt cannot be reduced to less than 0). The Enforcers will sell these fighters to the Guilders. If they're lucky, the fighter will live the rest of their life as a slave - if they're not, they'll be surgically and psychologically converted into a Servitor. Decrease the gang leader's LD by 1 for each fighter sold in this manner.

>Arrests: Any fighters arrested by the Enforcers during the battle will need to be bailed out. Players will have the opportunity to do this at the End of Week.

The Compliant gang, if they didn't team up against the Enforcers, concludes the starting scenario as the Winner.

# ...I WON! :id=iwon

In the event that the Enforcers bottle out, or are wiped out, several things may happen. 
1. No matter what, no gangs will owe any "taxes" for the next 3 weeks. At that point, the Enforcers will regroup, and taxes will return as before.
2. Any fighters arrested during the battle are returned to their gang. If the fight continues, they may be redeployed in their gang's scenario-defined deployment zone.
3. All fighters who fought the Enforcers improve their "CL" by 1. The leader of those gangs also improve their "LD" by 1. Stat maximums still apply!
4. 10 reputation is split evenly among all gangs who fought the enforcers, rounding down. 

What happens next depends on the other gang. If other gangs remain on the board that *did not* team up with the Debtors, resolve the scenario as usual. Otherwise, the Debtor, and any gangs that agreed to team up with them (even if they involuntarily bottled out), raid the now-empty precinct: 

- All prisoners are freed! Each raiding gang recruits 1 ganger or 1 juve from this riff-raff for free. They come with no equipment but during Post-Battle they may be equipped with any gear from their gang's house list (paying the usual house price) or the gang's stash. They may immediately be used in the next battle. Any fighters previously arrested by Enforcers are returned to their gangs.
- There are 4 Loot Crates and 4 Credit Crates in the precinct. These are split evenly among the participating gangs. Credit Crates contain 2d6x10 credits. Loot Crates contain rare gear, see the [Crate Tables](tables.md#crates) for instructions on resolving the contents of a Loot Crate. Roll off if even distribution isn't possible.
- If this battle was fought over a territory, roll a D6: 
| Roll | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | The territory remains unclaimed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2-4  | One of the other gangs snuck in and claimed it in the chaos! The territory goes to the player that didn't participate in the battle (the player who controlled the Enforcers counts as not participating for this purpose). If there's more than one eligible gang, the one with the lowest gang rating gets it. |
| 5-6  | The raiding gangs decide who among themselves will take control of the territory. If they cannot come to an agreement within one minute, they roll off for it.                                                                                                                                                   |
