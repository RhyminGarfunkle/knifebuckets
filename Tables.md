# Crate Contents :id=crates

Some scenarios allow Crates to be collected by gangs, or give Crates as rewards for victory. Crates can contain extremely rare items, including House specific weapons - for many items, these Crates are the only way for certain gangs, or any gang, to obtain them.

**Credit Crates** give the collecting gang 2D6x10 credits.

**Loot Crates** give equipment. The contents of a Loot Crate are determined by rolling on a series of tables.

**First, roll 1d6.** If the die shows 1-3, the crate contains a Weapon. Otherwise, it contains Wargear.

# Crate Contents: Weapons

If the crate contains a Weapon, roll 1d6. 1-3 is a Close Combat Weapon, 4-6 is a Long Range Weapon.
