# POST-BATTLE SEQUENCE

This sequence of actions is to be followed after the conclusion of every battle.

# 0. HIRED GUNS

Any Hired Guns chosen for the battle are returned to the **Hired Gun pool**. They may not be hired again this week.

If any Hired Gun was taken Out of Action, roll an Injury dice. On an Out of Action (skull) result, they die, and may not be hired again this campaign.
- If the perished Hired Gun is an Enforcer, when the dice shows an Out of Action, roll on the Permanent Injury Table and apply any results, ignoring Critical Injury and Death results. This Enforcer may not be hired again, but still deploys as part of the Enforcers.

# 1. RESOLVE SERIOUS INJURIES

For every fighter that remains **Seriously Injured** at the battle's end, roll a D6. On a 3+, they survive with no further complications. Remove them from the board. On a 2 or less, they succumb to their injuries - make a Lasting Injury roll for them, as though they went Out of Action.

# 2. RECEIVE EXPERIENCE :id=experience

In addition to any experience listed in the scenario rules, *all gang members* that participated in the battle receive D3 experience just for showing up.

# 3. CAPTIVES

If only one gang is on the battlefield at this point (the "Victor Gang"), they may capture one of their fallen enemies. 

Every fighter that meets the following criteria is a Possible Captive: 
- Belongs to a gang, i.e. not an Enforcer, Bounty Hunter, or other non-gang-member.
- Is not a member of the Victor Gang
- Went Out of Action during the battle (including those that went Out of Action during the Resolve Serious Injuries step)
- Did **not** suffer a Memorable Death or Critical Injury for their Lasting Injury roll 
  
Add together the total number of Possible Captives. Add to this the number of fighters from the Victor Gang who are still on the board. Finally, add 1D6. 

If this number is equal to or greater than 11, a fighter has been captured! Shuffle together the Fighter Cards for every Possible Captive, and draw one off the top. That fighter has been captured by the Final Gang!

> If there were more than two gangs participating in the battle, count fighters from all non-Victor gangs together as Possible Captives. Only one captive will be taken, but it can be from any gang.

Enforcers may not be taken captive, but they can take captives like any other gang if they were the last gang standing **unless the scenario describes otherwise.**

# 4. RECEIVE REWARDS

Receive any Rewards as described in the scenario rules. Any equipment gained is added to the gang's Stash, to be distributed during the End of Week.

If this battle was over a **Territory,** the victorious player takes control of that Territory. If the battle ended in a draw, no Territory changes hands. If the Territory was Unclaimed it remains in this week's pool of Territories, and if there is another player with a Lead this week they may attempt to fight over it.

# 5. TREAT CRITICAL INJURIES

Any fighters that rolled a Critical Injury on the Lasting Injury Table must be rushed to the local doc! If they're not treated, they'll die immediately.

For each Critically Injured fighter, perform the following action: 

**MEDICAL ESCORT:** Pay 1D6x10 credits. Gangs may trade equipment for its full value in lieu of cash, but will not receive "change" for transaction. If the gang cannot, or does not wish to, pay the fee, the injured fighter will immediately perish. Otherwise, roll a D6 on the following table:

| Result | Outcome                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-4    | **Stabilized:** Roll another D6. This is the second dice of a D66 roll, the first result is automatically a 5. Apply the result to the Lasting Injuries table. |
| 5-6    | **Full Recovery:** The fighter goes into Recovery, but suffers no lasting effects.                                                                             |

# 6. UPDATE ROSTER

Any dead fighters are removed from that player's Roster. If that player had fighters on the battlefield at the end of the battle, or the fighter died during a Medical Escort, the fighter's equipment is returned to the stash (except any **armor** the fighter was wearing, which was damaged beyond use and is lost forever).
