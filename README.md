# Overview

The death of Knifebuckets has left a power vacuum in the Underhive! Newly unclaimed riches await any upstart gang willing to reach out and take them. Just don't forget your position - Knifebuckets had a cushy understanding with the local Enforcers, and they expect whoever comes next to keep the juice flowing.

The campaign is divided into 13 weeks. Unlike traditional Necromunda campaigns, these are in-game weeks, not real-world weeks, played out in group sessions. These weeks are divided into Invasion (1 week), Occupation (5 weeks), Downtime (1 week), and Takeover (6 weeks). Invasion is the first battle, with each gang duking it out to grab starting resources for themselves. During Occupation, gangs expand into new territory, battling each other for the juiciest bits. During Downtime, gangs may take on some extra work. During Takeover, gangs start to butt in on each other's turf, taking from each other instead from the Hive. 
  
During the week, all players have a single Challenge, and half the players have Leads. Players with Leads select a territory to attempt to take over, and other players may use their Challenges to try to take that territory for themselves.

Fighter advancements, visits to the Trading Post, wound recovery, and other actions happen at the end of each in-game week.

During the Downtime phase, players recuperate, and up to three players have the option of working together to permanently put down the Enforcers.

# Invasion

The first week of the campaign has only a single battle, the First Scenario. No captives may be taken in this battle. After it's been fought, the week immediately ends and players move on to the End of Week. The next week is Week 2, the first week of the Takeover phase.

# The Week
At the start of the week during *Occupation* and *Takeover* phases, a number of **Leads** are generated, equal to half the number of players (rounded up). To generate leads, all players roll off. The highest roller gets the first **lead**, the second highest the second, etc. Draw a number of territory cards equal to the number of **leads plus one**, face up. If a player doesn't have a **Lead** this week, their only chance for a territory is to *challenge* someone.

Each player starts the week with one **Challenge**, including players with Leads.
 The player with the current lead is called the **Knife** (because they're about to cut off a piece for themselves!). The Knife either selects a territory, or passes.
 After the Knife picks a Territory, any player who has a *Challenge* may spend it to challenge the Knife for control of that territory. All players with a *Challenge* to spend declare if they wish to fight over the territory or not - if no players challenge, the the Knife immediately takes the territory and either the next player with a Lead becomes the new Knife and selects a territory, or the week ends if there are no more Leads. If one or more players wish to fight over the territory, those players lose their *Challenge* and engage in a Battle to determine who takes control of the territory!

> The maximum number of gangs that can participate in a battle over territory is the total number of players minus one. The player(s) not participating in the battle act as Arbitrator, and may sometimes play an additional non-gang faction in the battle.
>
> If all four players wish to participate in a battle over a territory, give preference to players who don't have a Lead.

> Generally, players who do not have a Lead for the week may only participate in one battle, the one they spend their Challenge on. Players with a Lead may participate in two battles, one they pick as the Knife, and another they spend a Challenge on.

 If any gang participating in the battle is in **Debt**, pick and set up a scenario as usual. After the entire first round is played, implement the [Enforcer Intervention rules](enforcers.md).
 When the battle is over, whoever was the **Victor** (according to the rules of the Scenario) receives the territory. Unless otherwise specified by the scenario, if there was no single victor, the territory does not change hands.
 If the Knife passes, they essentially move their Lead to last place: all other players with Leads may select territories, receive Challenges, etc. The next time their Lead comes up, they **must** pick a territory: your gangers can smell cowardice, and refusing a chance to expand is a great way to wake up with a slashed throat!
 After each battle, victorious gangs may take captives, and critical injuries are treated. Other post-battle actions occur at the End of the Week. See the Post-Battle rules for details.

# Downtime

Between the **Occupation** and **Takeover** phases is **Downtime**. After the final Occupation **End of Week**, calculate the new Underdog status, then:​ 
1. All fighters in **Recovery** are immediately restored.
2. All captives, including those held by Enforcers, are returned to their gangs. 
3. All fighters receive 2D6 experience. 
4. All gangs with an **Underdog (X)** status receive 150 x **(X)**. These credits must be spent immediately on fighters and equipment - any unspent credits are lost, not placed in the gang's stash. These credits may be supplemented by credits in the stash, which are not lost.
​
In the game-week between **Occupation** and **Takeover**, normal battles over territory do not occur. If they wish, players may band together to take down the Enforcers once and for all - any number of players may band together in a Formal Alliance and play the Precinct Assault scenario (one player must be the Enforcers in this case - if all players in the campaign wish to enter the Alliance, roll off to see who will control the Enforcers).

If no players wish to engage the Enforcers, players play the special Pitfight scenario. Participation in this battle isn't mandatory, but if only one player participates they win by default.

After the special Downtime scenario is played, there is another End-of-Week (resolved as usual) then the **Takeover** phase begins.

# Takeover

At the start of Week 7 the Takeover phase begins. The Takeover phase is played much like the Occupation phase. Players roll for leads, and if there are any unclaimed Territories remaining, these are drawn at the start of the week like in the Occupation phase. 
  
In addition to unclaimed territory cards, during Takeover the Knife may pick a territory card already claimed by another player! In this case, the player who controls the territory automatically Challenges and takes part in the battle, even if they've already spent their Challenge this week. Other players may spend a Challenge to join the fight for that territory. The MAX GANGS rule remains in effect.

# Special Battles

## Captive Recovery

If one player has **Captured** another player's fighter(s), at the end of the week (before performing the End of Week actions) the captured fighter's gang (Rescuer) may challenge the capturing gang (Captor). The Rescuer does not need a Challenge to do this.

If the Captor declines, the hostage is immediately returned. If the Captor accepts, the Rescuer and Captor play the **Rescue Mission** scenario. If the Rescuer refuses to challenge, the Captor may do with their Captive as they please during the End of Week (options include selling the fighter, putting them to work in a territory, or permanently maiming the fighter).
​ 
It's rare that gangs get so desperate that they ask another for help, but captive rescue is one of those times. A gang may hire another gang to help and enter into a Formal Alliance with them for the duration of the Rescue mission. They may negotiate the payment between them.

> Payment for help with a hostage rescue may include credits, territories, weapons and wargear, or even real-world rewards outside the game!

If a single gang has captives from multiple other gangs, those gangs may work together to rescue their fighters. If all Rescuers agree, they may form a Formal Alliance that lasts for the single scenario.

There are certain other special battles that may be undertaken during the campaign.

## Precinct Assault

During Downtime, players may band together to attempt to take on the Enforcers once and for all! Winning this battle will mean the permanent elimination of taxes from the remainder of the campaign. Failure will mean dire consequences for all gangs that participated in the uprising against order.

## Pit Brawl

During Downtime, if they don't fight the Enforcers, players can each send a Champion to fight in an Enforcer-sponsored Pit Brawl for the entertainment of the rest of the Underhive! The winning gangs will be rewarded, with the top gang receiving several weeks of reprieve from taxes.

# Campaign End
