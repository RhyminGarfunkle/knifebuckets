# Introduction

If you've found yourself directly at the repository, you'll have a much better time if you look at [main page](https://rhymingarfunkle.github.io/knifebuckets) instead.

Knifebuckets is a home-brewed campaign for a popular Underhive Skirmish Game. It's a heavy modification of the basic Dominion campaign, modified in an attempt to accomplish the following goals:

- Increase accessibility for players who have other hobbies and time commitments. Most players shouldn't need to buy anything except a single box of ten miniatures!
- Be fun for a small group of players, in our case four.
- Be playable by the entire gaming group simply coming together once a week
- Allow every battle to accommodate more than two players
- Eliminate the need for an external arbitrator
- Focus on improving and advancing your gang's fighters, instead of simply buying new and better fighters.
- Let the game take itself slightly less seriously

Knifebuckets features huge XP gains - fighters often receive enough XP to advance from a single battle! Advancements are semi-random, providing organic growth and a minimal amount of min-maxing, while still giving control over the general direction of your gang. 

**Advancements are the primary way of getting highly skilled and valuable fighters.** In fact, after gang creation, you may only hire Gangers and Juves. Champions may be hired if all existing Champions have been killed, but all of our gangs have promoted a Juve to a Champion before that happened!

Frequent advancements are balanced out with more limited Trading Post access, and a per-territory taxation system courtesy of the Enforcers.

If that all sounds good, look through the rule pages to start exploring! "Overview" is a great place to start.

# KEY CHANGES

If you've played lots of Underhive Skirmish Game, here are some notable rule changes to be aware of for Knifebuckets:

- When collecting territory resources, taxes are levied by the Enforcers for every territory a gang holds besides their initial Settlement.
- Many actions that were previously done after every battle are instead resolved during the "End of Week" phase. This means gangs may need to fight two or more battles before collecting territory resources, purchasing equipment, etc.
- During the End of Week, all fighters may swap out equipment - you're not locked to what the fighter had on gang creation!
- Hired Guns cost half their credit value to hire, but are only ever present for a single battle - no rules to keep track of about if they'll stick around.
- Pitch Black and Sneak Attack have been significantly reworked, to be more streamlined and hopefully a little more fun for participating players. See [Special Scenario Rules](specialscenariorules.md) for details.
- When visiting the Trading Post, fighters may only buy a *single* item, not unlimited.
- Champions cannot be hired, only promoted from lower ranking fighters (there is an exception if all Champions in a gang have died).
- Fighters receive experience for many different actions (including simply showing up for battle!) and often receive much more than in the basic rules. Additionally, the way Advancements happen has been significantly reworked. See [Fighters](fighters.md) for details.

# Why?

Knifebuckets addresses some of my personal dissatisfaction with the increasingly "serious" and "gritty" and worst of all "expensive" tone that's being taken with the official Underhive Skirmish Game. This is a game about toddler-brained muscle men punching cranked-out parkour Amazonians while cackling trash priests set everything on fire, and the only hairstyle is "mohawk" - why are we spending any time talking about house politics? Why do my friends need to buy three boxes of miniatures, two books, and $150 worth of FW minis just to play it with me?

Most players will only need to purchase a single box of gang miniatures.

# What you'll need to play

Most players will only need to purchase a single box of miniatures from their chosen gang, currently roughly $42 USD at most retailers. That's it! If a player's gang is *extremely successful* they may wish to purchase an additional box of fighters, but this won't be necessary for most players (even those with more than 10 fighters in their gang will likely never field that many in a single scenario, so may swap models to represent different fighters if they wish).

One player will need several D6 (12 seems to be a good number), preferably in at least two colors, in addition to the special Necromunda dice (Scatter, Injury, and Ammo). You'll also need a collection of tokens to represent the various statuses and conditions of fighters. You'll have plenty of all of these if you purchased any official Underhive Skirmish Game starter sets. Otherwise dice and tokens are readily available at retail, or third party made versions are always for sale on Etsy or from various gaming retailers.

Additionally, **at least one player will need to invest in terrain, and some additional miniatures,** in addition to the box of miniatures representing their gang. MDF terrain can be purchased at a steep discount from plastic - $200 of MDF terrain can provide as rich a play experience as several thousand dollars worth of plastic terrain. Many players enjoy simply playing on stacked together books and Lego!

Tactics Cards can be difficult or extremely expensive to purchase. You can simply list them out and use any random selection method in lieu of drawning them. Alternately, you can have your own Tactics Cards made by manufacturers that specialize in small runs of custom cards - I had 150 tactics cards made for less than $40, including shipping from China. Just make sure that you don't ask the printers to print any art you don't have the rights to!

Miniatures will be needed to represent the Enforcers and any Hired Guns in the campaign. Many Enforcers pull double-duty as Hired Guns.

Enforcers for our campaign were created from one box of 10 Palanite Enforcers, and one sprue of 3 Subjugators, plus 3 Hardcase Cyber-Mastiffs (there are many excellent and appropriate third-party robot dog miniatures available online), for a total of 16 fighters.

Players may omit the Enforcers entirely from the campaign, but they provide a significant leveling element, especially in the first half of the campaign. Omitting the Enforcers may lead to some players gaining early insurmountable leads over everyone else.

Alternatively, players may wish to keep the Enforcer's "Taxes" to level the playing field, but not have them as an in-battle element. In this case, simply force all players to pay their full "taxes" in the End of Week, and don't offer the Precinct Assault scenario during Downtime.

Hired Guns may use any appropriate miniature. If you want to make them on the cheap, individual sprues for various gangs can often be purchased very cheaply on eBay. Fighter Cards for your Hired Guns may be taken from official sources, or you can use the Hired Guns here, or make your own!

# Recommended Gangs

It's recommended that players new to the Underhive Skirmish Game stick to one of the six "House" gangs - **Goliath, Escher, Orlock, Van Saar, Delaque, and Cawdor.** This is simply for ease of play, as those gangs all have very clear and obvious rules for things like gang composition, tactics cards, item availability, etc.

For the uninitiated, Goliath are super strong, Cawdor are individually poor fighters but have strength in numbers, Escher are fast and mobile, Van Saar are extremely effective sharpshooters, Delaque like to sneak around, and Orlocks are right in the middle. When in doubt, play the gang you like the looks of!

As written in these campaign rules, the Enforcers are not a player-controlled gang - they are a balancing element, enforcing the taxation system, and at times providing a common enemy for all players to work against. When they show up, players who's gangs are not part of the battle will be responsible for playing the Enforcers. Keep this in mind if a player wishes to play as an Enforcer gang - there's no reason that they couldn't play using the rules of any other gang in the Knifebuckets campaign, but you'll probably want to at least make sure they have a different color scheme!

If someone *really* wants to run **Squats, Gene Stealer Cults, Nomads,** or **any other non-House gang (including Enforcers),** it's recommended that they spend some time studying the rules to this game (core rules, fighter skills, tactics cards, and this campaign) and put in significant thought as to how they'll incorporate their chosen gang into this Campaign - for example, what tactics cards will they use for their starting deck? If playing Nomads, how will they use their gang's skills, which are largely tied to scenarios played in the Ash Wastes?

Non-house gangs are certainly possible in Knifebuckets, but they will require careful consideration on the part of those gang's players to ensure a fun gaming experience for all players.

# Vehicles and the Ash Wastes

The Knifebuckets campaign contains **no scenarios or provisions for playing in the Ash Wastes.**

While the Mad Max-style car wars of the Ash Wastes certainly sound rad as heck, this campaign is focused on accessibility - vehicles provide a whole extra set of complex rules on top of an already massively complex game, in addition to a whole bunch of big, expensive models to purchase, assemble, and paint.

# On WYSIWYG

Knifebuckets focuses on advancing those fighters who are already in your gang. In addition to lots of experience and advancements, you can change all of your fighters loadouts periodically, either with stuff in the stash, rare item obtained in special missions, or black-market goodies from the Trading Post. If advancements give a fighter better WS than BS, you'll likely want to trade in their sniper rifle for a chainsword!

Some players are extremely attached to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get, typically pronounced Wissy-Wig) modeling of their fighters, where the items on the fighter's model perfectly match with the items on the fighter's card. This becomes extremely difficult to do when fighters frequently change equipment.

While the preference will come down to each group, our group chose to abandon WYSIWYG entirely. Each model represents a particular fighter, but the equipment the model is holding may have nothing to do with what the fighter is actually equipped with. We found that as fighters advanced, we wanted to recognize who was who, not who's holding what - it's better to know at a glance which Goliaths have 6 Toughness, or which Van Saars have 2+ BS even in partial cover, than who's carrying the big gun.

Instead of WYSIWYG, we simply ask our fellow players, "What's this guy equipped with?"

*"But WYSIWYG makes play faster, communicating at a glance what every fighter is holding!"*

Does it really? Nobody but the most dedicated, hardcore player, exhaustively versed in the lore of the game and the universe at large, could possibly tell from three feet away if a 1 inch tall figure is holding a las rifle or a plasma rifle. Even if you could, can you tell what kind of grenade it's holding? A Frag vs a Flash vs a Gas grenade will have radically different tactical implications. Same thing goes for a Stub Gun vs a Plasma Pistol.

What about armor? How are you going to model a Goliath fighter wearing mesh armor instead of the standard furnace plates? Or an Escher with a displacer field? Heck, if you didn't play Goliath, how would you even know what a Krumper Cannon looks like, let alone what the stats are?

In all cases, it's far easier to just ask other players about loadouts, and freely examine other player's fighter cards. The "logical" argument in favor of WYSIWYG fall apart with even a little bit of thought.

If you enjoy modeling your fighters to match their cards, that's great! I would never dream of taking that aspect of the hobby away from you. If I had the time and money, I'd love to model a robot exoskeleton onto my triple-bionic ganger! However, forcing others do it just puts up a massive barrier - a huge investment of both time and money - preventing other players from enjoying the game with you. Why would you want do that?

# Core Rules

It's well known among the playing community that Underhive Skirmish Game's rules are kind of a mess, with almost a dozen books providing multiple versions of different rules, some of them contrary to each other, and none of them giving a satisfactory answer to many common rule interactions.

Our group uses the "YCE" rules for core gameplay, available from [Yaktribe.Games](https://yaktribe.games). This ruleset is **short** (less than 60 pages total), accounts for many common situations, provide some key balancing and flavor solutions (Jump distance is determined by move range, not base size - finally, a nimble Escher can jump further than a clumsy Goliath!), and are broadly compatible with most official material (Some tactics cards require minor common-sense adaptations).

I highly recommend the YCE rules, and while I have tried my best to make this campaign core-rule agnostic, if you ever run into something that doesn't quite make sense with the core rulebook, it's likely that this is where the issue lies.
