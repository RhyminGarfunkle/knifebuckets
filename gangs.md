# GANGS

Many books introduce many complicated rules for putting together and managing gangs. Because this campaign is aimed at players who don't wish to dedicate their entire lives to playing this game, great simplification is recommended - for example, rules for Brutes and Hangers-On are intentionally not included as part of this campaign.

However, many gang rules provide great flavor and special boons to different gangs, without a massive bookkeeping and rules overhead. It's up to all players to discuss among the group *before the campaign begins* what house and gang rules will be used.

For example, in our campaign with four players playing Goliath, Escher, Van Saar, and Cawdor, we used the basic Book of the Underhive gang rules, with the following additions:

- Goliath may increase the price of any ganger on hiring by 15 credits to increase their Toughness by 1
- Escher increases the Cool of all gangers by 1 on hire, and may create special stimms, toxins, and gasses with Chem Alchemy
- Cawdor may always add 1 to their maximum crew size in all scenarios.
- Van Saar always adds an additional 2 to all Rare and Illegal trades during the End of Week

Our goal was to reduce the amount of extra rules and bookkeeping while still keeping some unique flavor - this is already a massively complicated game! If every player in your game wishes to use all Gang House rules, there's no reason not to.

# GANG COMPOSITION

Initial gangs are created with a limit of 800 credits.

Bear in mind weapon restrictions when equipping fighters:
- Juves may only be given pistols and close combat weapons worth less than 20 credits until their first advancement, after which they may be given any weapon.
- Gangers may be given basic weapons, special weapons, close combat weapons, and pistols, but *no heavy weapons.*
- Leaders and Champions have no restrictions.

Only one Ganger may be equipped with a Special weapon on gang creation. This limitation no longer applies after the first week.

Note the following additional rules when creating a gang: 

- A gang **must hire one Leader,** and **may hire one Champion on creation.** All other fighters must be Gangers or Juves.
- There is no limitation on how many Gangers or Juves you must maintain relative to other fighter types.
- In addition to the free skills given to Leaders and Champions, on gang creation you may select **two skills** from your gang's primary skillset and distribute them to **any fighters** as you wish. No fighter may have more than one skill at this point, except your Leader, who may have two.
 
# FUTURE HIRING

The following limitations apply when hiring additional fighters after the initial gang composition: 

- Leaders **can never be hired** after initial gang creation. They can only be promoted from other fighters (see [Death of a Leader](#deathofaleader))
- Champions **can never be hired** after initial creation *unless* the player's last champion has been killed - in this case they may hire a single champion, at the regular price.
-- Note that this only applies if the final champion is killed: if a player chooses to retire a Champion, or never hired one on creation, they may not hire a replacement!
- A gang may gain additional Champions by promoting fighters. Gangs are limited to a **maximum of two Champions.**
  
Remember when hiring that Juves are initially weaker than Gangers, but advance much faster and will receive many more promotions (assuming they survive!).

# EQUIPPING FIGHTERS

Fighters may not carry more than three weapons. Many weapons count as taking up the space of two for this purpose, such as weapons with the Unwieldy trait or weapons with multiple profiles/ammos. 

Fighters can only change their loadout during the [End of Week phase](endofweek.md). All fighters, including Gangers and Juves, may change loadouts at that time. All fighters have a single loadout. 

If a Juve hasn't received any advancements, it can only be equipped with pistols or close combat weapons, none of which can be worth more than 20 credits.

Heavy Weapons may only be used by Leaders and Champions.

# RETIREMENT :id=retire

Occasionally a fighter may become so worn-down through permanent injuries that it's no longer worth keeping them in your gang. In this case you may **Retire** a fighter. This may be done during the [End of Week,](endofweek.md#buy) during the Buy and Re-Equip step.

To **Retire** a Fighter, you must first either pay d6x10 credits (as a pension) **or** worsen your Leader's LD stat by 1 - Gangers don't like it when they see one of their own isn't being taken care of!

You may then remove the fighter permanently from your gang roster, and reduce the rating of your Gang by that much. All of the retired fighter's equipment is recovered and placed in the gang's Stash.

Leaders may not retire. The only way out for them is death.

# DEATH OF A LEADER :id=deathofaleader

If the Leader is killed, another fighter must take on the mantle. Select a new leader during the Post-Battle, after step 5, Update Roster. 

Use the following steps to pick a leader:

- The new leader must be a Champion.
- If you have no Champion, the new leader must be a Specialist.
- If you have no Specialist, the new leader must be a Ganger.
- If you have no Gangers, the new leader must be a Juve.
- If there are multiple eligible fighters, the fighter with the highest Leadership stat must be selected. 

Improve the new Leader's LD stat by 1. If the new Leader wasn't a Champion, improve their Attack and Wounds stats by 1 each, and pick 1 skill to learn from the fighter's Primary skill set. Finally, give the new Leader one standard advancement without paying any XP. Max Stat rules must still be respected.

Dying is the only way a Leader may be retired from a Gang. They may not retire voluntarily.

# DESTRUCTION OF A GANG

If you have no living fighters at all, your gang has been destroyed! Create a new gang, following all Gang Composition rules. The starting credit limit for this new gang is 800 + (100 * the number of weeks that have passed in the campaign).
