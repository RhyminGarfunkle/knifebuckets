# Common Rule Reference

Necromunda is a big game. For our campaign and rules, these are the most common rules requiring reference.

(For anyone not part of our group, note that we use the "YCE" rules for core gameplay, which make many small but significant changes to the core rules! As such, these rule notes may not apply to your game.)

# Specific Movement Costs

Vertical movement is given in multiples of 2.5 inches because that is the height of a typical ZM-style column or wall.

- **Upwards 2.5 Inches, No Ladder:** 4 inches
 -- **Why?** The first half inch of vertical movement can be "stepped-up" for free. The remaining two inches take 4 inches to traverse, because climbing costs twice as much as normal movement.

- **Upwards 2.5 Inches with Ladder:** 2 Inches
-- **Why?** The first half inch of vertical movement can be "stepped-up" for free. The remaining two inches only require two inches of movement to traverse, because the climbing penalty doesn't apply when using a ladder to climb.

- **Downwards 2.5 Inches, No Ladder:** 3 Inches, or Fall Check
-- **Why?** Fighters can fall 1 inch with no penalty. This means that the the fighter must climb downwards for the first 1.5 inches, which cost double the usual movement cost because it's vertical movement with no ladder. The fighter may instead choose to make a Fall Check, becoming Pinned (but suffering no damage) if they fail.

- **Downwards 2.5 Inches with Ladder:** 1.5 Inches, or Fall Check
-- **Why?** Fighters can fall 1 inch with no penalty. This means that the fighter must climb down the first 1.5 inches, but there is no additional movement penalty because they're using a ladder to climb.

- **Downwards 5 Inches, No Ladder:** 8 Inches, or Fall Check
-- **Why?** The fighter must climb down the first 4 inches (no ladder makes it cost twice as much), at which point they can fall the remaining inch for free. Most fighters can only move this far as part of a Double Move, or Charge.

# Fall Checks

When a fighter falls, they must pass an initiative test with a penalty based on height. Failing this test means they will be **pinned** and suffer a hit with the listed Strength, AP, and Damage.

| Fall Distance | Initiative Penalty | Strength | AP | Damage |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| More than 1", less than 3" (one story) | - | - | - | - |
| 3" or more, less than 5" (two stories, not directly on building) | -1 | 3 | - | 1 |
| More than 5", less than 7" (two stories directly on top of a building) | -2 | 5 | -1 | 1 |
| More than 7", less than 9" (three stories) | -3 | 7 | -2 | 2 |
| More than 9"| -4 | 9 | -3 | 3 |

If falling results in landing on top of another fighter, they are both **pinned** (regardless of the Initiative test) and take the **same hit.** If neither fighter went **Out of Action**, move the falling fighter the shortest possible distance so that they are not overlapping. If the fighters are enemies, and neither fighter became Seriously Injured, move the Falling fighter so that it's at least 1 inch from the other.

# Nerve Tests

Whenever a fighter goes Out of Action, make a Nerve Test for any friendly fighter that was within 3" of that Fighter.

>If the fighter went Out of Action in such a way that they weren't on the board when it happened (for example, **Plummeting** in the Towers terrain) make the check for each fighter within 3 inches of where the fighter was before they did the action that caused them to fall. In the **Plummeting** example, make the test for fighters 3" from the spot where the fighter fell.

To make a Nerve Test, make a **Cool Check** with a +1 modifier for each friendly **Operational Fighter** within 3". A fighter can only make one Nerve Test per round, regardless of how many fighters go Out of Action this round.

> Fighters are considered **Operational** if they are Active, Engaged, or Pinned, and are not suffering any condition that would prevent them from activating normally. **Seriously Injured** fighters are not Operational, nor are fighters suffering from conditions like Broken, Insane, Blaze, etc.

# Action Types

**Simple Actions** require 1 Action to perform. They can be made multiple times per Activation.

**Basic Actions** require 1 Action to perform, but may *only per done once* per Activation.

**Double Actions** require 2 Actions to perform. They may only be performed once per Activation, even if the fighter has 4 or more Actions available.

**Free Actions** require no actions to perform. The number of times any specific Free Action may be performed are specified by the action's rules. In the absence of specificity, assume a Free Action may only be performed once per Activation.

# Hard Target

Fighters only gain **Hard Target** if they perform two or more consecutive **Move** actions, or **Consolidate** as part of a Coup de Grace. Actions that allow for moving twice as far as usual, like Charge, do not provide the Hard Target status in themselves.

**Hard Target** increases the fighter's cover by 1. No Cover becomes Partial, Partial becomes Full. Fighters in Full Cover gain no benefit from Hard Target.

# Ammo Checks

When a weapon with multiple profiles/ammos goes Out of Ammo, that weapon **cannot be used** at all until it's reloaded, regardless of the desired ammo or profile.

When making an ammo check for a weapon with multiple profiles/ammos, you *must* use the ammo stat for the profile/ammo that the weapon failed the initial ammo check with. Even if that ammo is no longer usable, for example due to having the "scarce" trait, use that ammo/profile's stat to reload the weapon and return it to operational condition.

# Template and Blast Weapons

Template weapons auto hit any fighter who's base is under the template, **as long as there is no solid terrain between the attacker and the target.** This means that barricades and other "scatter" terrain is passed through, but if there are solid walls or floors between the attacker and the target, the attacker must be able to see at least a small portion of the target.

The same goes for blast weapons, except you check visibility from the center of the blast, not the attacking fighter.

# House Rules

- **Run and Gun** cannot be used with weapons that use a Flame Template.

- If a fighter has the **Insane** condition, they may roll the **Willpower Check** to lose it at the end of every activation, not just ones where they rolled a 4 or 5.

- To use **Overseer** a fighter must first pass a Leadership check.
