# DIPLOMACY

# Informal Alliances

Informal alliances via tabletalk are possible at any time. There's nothing stopping two gangs from working together to put down a third. Just remember that, without a Formal Alliance, there are no safeguards, and you'll need to fight each other eventually to win - don't be the first one stabbed in the back!

> Informal Alliances do not change the game rules in any way. For example, if gang A and gang B enter an informal alliance, fighters from gang A may not move through gang B's fighters as through they were friendly. If a fighter from gang C was engaged with fighters from both gangs A and B, fighters from A  wouldn't grant fighters from B assistance in combat. Even if they're not actively shooting at each other, they're still enemies!

Compensation for these informal alliances is also open-ended. Players may exchange credits or  equipment in the stash, territories, promises to have someone else's back in the next battle, real-world cash - there's little limit* on what players can trade among themselves at any time! Just remember that there's no guarantee that the other player will keep their word.

Remember, making a habit of breaking your word is a great way to get other players to gang up on you!

> *The only hard limit is on trading fighters. Fighters are an extension of their gang and may **not** be traded, given away, sold, or leave their gang except through [Retiring](gangs.md#retire) during the End of Week.

# Formal Alliances :id=formal

In limited circumstances - teaming up to take on the Enforcers, or recruiting another gang to assist in a Hostage Rescue scenario -  players may enter into a **Formal Alliance.** Formal Alliances last until the end of the battle, and may not be exited before then. When in a Formal Alliance with another player, observe the following:

1. The allied gangs may not directly target each other for attacks. Friendly Fire is still possible with template weapons, stray shots, and other indirect ways of dealing damage.
2. Fighters may move through allied fighters as though they were in the same gang.
3. Fighters from an allied gang count as friendly for Interference, forcing open a Door, and most other tests that name "Friendly Fighters."
4. All gangs perform bottle tests individually, and only count Out of Actions from their own gang's fighters when making them. Fighters are not at risk of becoming Broken when an allied fighter goes Out of Action near them. Think of allied gangs as providing **material support, not emotional support!**
5. If the players are victorious, they split any scenario rewards evenly. If the battle was over a Territory, players decide amongst themselves who that Territory goes to - if they cannot come to a decision in **one minute,** roll off for it.
6. If one gang involuntarily bottles out and all their fighters flee due to failing cool checks, and the other gang wins the fight, both gangs will count as having won. If a gang **chooses** to voluntarily flee after bottling out, they are breaking the alliance and will get nothing if the other wins!

> Hostage Rescue and Precinct Assault are the **only** scenarios where players may enter into Formal Alliances. Players may enter or leave Informal Alliances at any time.
