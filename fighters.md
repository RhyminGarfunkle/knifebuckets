# FIGHTERS, EXPERIENCE, AND ADVANCEMENT

# EXPERIENCE

There are many hard lessons to be learned in the Underhive. In battle, fighters gain experience for the following actions:

| Action | Experience |
|---|---|
| Each Attack action that causes at least 1 wound | 1 |
| Causing an enemy fighter to go Out of Action | 3 (+3 if enemy is a Leader, Champion, or Bounty Hunter) |
| Causing an enemy fighter to be Seriously Injured | 1d3 |
| Assisting a friendly fighter with a Recovery Roll | 1d3 |
| Rallying from being Broken | 1 |
| Going Out of Action* | 1d3 (stacks with Lesson Learned) |

> *Note that this only applies to Out of Actions from rolling an Injury Dice or having Toughness reduced to 0 by flesh wounds. Other actions that are treated as Out of Actions, such as fleeing due to bottling out, do not grant experience.

There are other ways to gain experience - for example, in the Post-Battle sequence of each battle, [fighters gain experience simply for participating](postbattle.md#experience).

# FIGHTER ADVANCEMENT

During the [End of Week](endofweek.md#advancements) fighters may spend their accumulated XP to receive Advancements.

Advancements are made by calculating the required amount of XP, removing that much XP from the ganger, then rolling 2D6 on an advancement table.

Keep track of how many advancements each fighter has received! Advancements become more expensive the more you get (with the exception of Juves and Gangers).


# ADVANCING GANGERS

Ganger advancements cost 8XP each, regardless of how many advancements they've previously made. Roll 2d6 and apply the results of the following table:

| 2d6 | Advancement |
|---|---|
| 2 | The fighter becomes a Specialist. Pick one skill to learn from one of their Primary skillsets and increase their value by 20. |
| 2-4 | Improve WS *or* BS by 1. Increase value by 20. |
| 5-6 | Improve Strength *or* Toughness by 1. Increase value by 30. |
| 7 | Improve Initiative by 1 *or* add 1" to Movement. Increase value by 10. |
| 8-9 | Improve Willpower *or* Intelligence by 1. Increase value by 5. Refund 2 XP. |
| 10-11| Improve Leadership or Cool by 1. Increase value by 5. Refund 2 XP. |
| 12 | The fighter becomes a Specialist. Pick one skill to learn from one of their Primary skillsets and increase their value by 20. |

If the table result would result in a violation of Max Stats, treat it as a roll of 12.

# ADVANCING ALL OTHER FIGHTERS

Other fighters pay 5 XP for their first Advancement. For all fighters except Juves, add 1 XP to the cost for each previous advancement this fighter has made.

> For example, a Juve's third advancement would still cost 5 credits. A Champion's third advancement would cost 7 credits - 5 for the bast cost, and 2 for the two Advancements it's already received.
>
> Note that many advancements (those that increase Cool, Int, Will, and Lead) are not marked as advancements. If one of the previously mentioned Champion's two advancements was one of these, his third advancement would be counted as his *second* advancement, so would only cost 6 credits.

If you're advancing a Specialist, you may choose to multiply the XP cost by 2 and automatically treat the advancement roll as a 12.

Roll 2d6 and apply the results of the following table:

| 2d6 | Advancement |
|---|---|
| 2 | The fighter gains a [semi-random skill](#semirandom) from one of their Secondary skill sets. Increase value by 30. |
| 3 | The fighter gains a [semi-random skill](#semirandom) from one of their Primary skill sets. Increase value by 20. |
| 4 | Improve Wounds *or* Attacks by 1. Increase value by 20. |
| 5 | Improve Strength *or* Toughness by 1. Increase value by 15. |
| 6 | Roll 1d6. 1-3: +1 Leadership, 4-6: +1 Cool. Increase value by 5. [Refund 2 XP](#refund) and [do not mark this advancement.](#donotmark) |
| 7 | Improve WS *or* BS by 1. Increase value by 20. |
| 8 | Roll 1d6. 1-3: +1 Willpower, 4-6: +1 Intelligence. Increase value by 5. [Refund 2 XP](#refund) and [do not mark this advancement.](#donotmark) |
| 9 | Improve Movement *or* Initiative by 1. Increase value by 10. |
| 10 | The fighter gains a [semi-random skill](#semirandom) from one of their Primary skill sets. Increase value by 20. |
| 11 | The fighter gains a [semi-random skill](#semirandom)  from one of their Secondary skill sets. Increase value by 30. |
| 12 | if the fighter is a Specialist, promote them to Champion (as long as the gang already has less than two Champions). Pick one skill to learn from one of their Primary skill sets. Additionally, improve A and LD by 1, and improve WS *or* BS by 1 (respecting the Max Stat rules). Increase value by 60. They may immediately make Trade actions in the End of Week phase.

Other fighters (or Specialists, if the gang already has two Champions) gain a random skill from any skill set they have access to (primary or secondary). Increase value by 30 for secondary, 20 for primary. |

If an advancement roll leaves you with no option that doesn't violate Max Stats, re-roll once. If you still cannot use the advancement, treat it as a roll of 12.


### Semi-random skills :id=semirandom
>Roll 2 d6 and select from the two indicated skills. You may re-roll the second skill until it's different from the first. If the fighter already has one skill, they *must* take the other. If the fighter already has *both* skills, continue rolling the D6 and take the first skill they don't already have.

### Do not mark this Advancement :id=donotmark
>If an advancement says "do not mark this advancement", it means that this advancement does not count towards the total number of advancements the fighter has received. It will not add to the number of advancements Juves can receive before being promoted, nor will it increase the cost of subsequent advancements for other fighters.

### Refund XP :id=refund
>If an advancement says "Refund (X) XP", immediately increase the fighter's XP by that amount. This may make them eligible to immediately take another advancement.
>
> For example, a juve with 8 XP pays 5 XP for an advancement, leaving them with 3 XP. They roll a 8 for the advancement: Int is increased by 1, and 2 XP is immediately refunded. This gives them a new total of 5 XP, which they can then immediately pay for another advancement, leaving them at 0 XP.

# MAX STATS

The following stat maxes apply to all fighters, regardless of gang or fighter type:

| Stat | Max (from Base) |
|---|---|
| WS | 2+ |
| BS | 2+ |
| I | 1+ |
| LD | 3+ |
| CL | 3+ |
| WIL | 3+ |
| INT | 3+ |

Movement, Strength, Toughness, Wounds, and Attacks cannot be improved by more than 2 compared to the fighter type's basic profile. For example, if a Juve has a WS of 5+, they cannot receive advancements that would make their WS better than 3+ until they're promoted to a different type.

If a fighter is promoted such that their current stats violate their new max stats, they are not reduced to their new max, but cannot increase that stat any further.

> For example, a Goliath Juve starts with a 5" move, then receives two Movement advancements, bringing them to a 7" move. They are then promoted to a Specialist, which ordinarily has a max Movement of 6". Their Movement stat is not reduced, but it can never be improved, either.

# PROMOTION

When a Juve receives 5 advancements, you may promote them to Specialist. When a Juve receives 7 advancements, you **must** promote them.

To promote a **Juve** to a Specialist, clear their advancement count (they retain all advancement results, but they start from 0 for XP cost). Additionally, give this fighter a **randomly selected Primary skill** (Unlike usual advancements, only roll a single skill. Only reroll if the fighter already has the rolled skill). Increase the fighter's value by 20.

**Specialists** may be promoted to Champion on an advancement roll of 12, or by paying double the XP cost. Gangs may not have more than 2 Champions - if the gang already has two Champions, the Specialist may not be promoted.

**Champions** can only become Leaders when the Leader dies.

# Permanent Injuries and Bionics

Stat reductions from permanent injuries can really mess up your gangers! These reductions can be mitigated, wholly or in part, by the installation of Bionics.

Bionics can be purchased during the Trade action, and are **permanently assigned** to the fighter who received them. Most rules for Bionics are the same as in the core book, with one major exception:

Fighters who receive a Bionic to "cure" their injuries **do not have their price increased** by the value of the bionic. Bionics don't make fighters better than they were before, they simply get fighters back up to speed. The bionic still must be purchased at full price.

> The exception to this is with bionics installed from the Cybertechnikae territory, specifically when installed on an uninjured fighter to improve their stats. In this case, because the bionic improves them beyond their usual abilities, increase the fighter's cost by the cost of the bionic.
