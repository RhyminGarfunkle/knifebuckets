# OVERVIEW

The death of Knifebuckets has left a power vacuum in the Underhive! Newly unclaimed riches await any upstart gang willing to reach out and take them. Just don't forget your position - Knifebuckets had a cushy understanding with the local Enforcers, and they expect whoever comes next to keep the juice flowing.

The campaign is divided into 4 phases. These phases are **Invasion** (first battle), **Occupation** (6 weeks), **Downtime** (in between weeks), and **Takeover** (6 weeks). Invasion is the first battle, with each gang duking it out to grab starting resources for themselves. During Occupation, gangs expand into new territory, battling each other for the juiciest bits. During Downtime, gangs recuperate, and may take on some extra work. During Takeover, gangs start to butt in on each other's turf, taking from each other instead from the Hive.

During the week, all players have a single Challenge, and half the players have Leads. Players with Leads select a territory to attempt to take over, and other players may use their Challenges to try to take that territory for themselves.

Fighter advancements, visits to the Trading Post, wound recovery, and other actions happen at the end of each in-game week.

During the Downtime phase, players recuperate, and up to three players have the option of working together to permanently put down the Enforcers.

# THE WEEK
Weeks are in-game weeks, not real-world weeks. During the Week, players battle each other for control of Territories. See [The Week](theweek.md) for details.

# END OF WEEK

During the End of Week, players collect resources from territories, spend collected experience on advancements, and purchase new fighters and equipment. See [End of Week](endofweek.md) for details.


# SPECIAL BATTLES

In addition to the initial Invasion battle and regular battles over territories, there are certain other special battles that may be undertaken during the campaign.

## Precinct Assault

During Downtime, players may band together to attempt to take on the Enforcers once and for all! Winning this battle will mean the permanent elimination of taxes from the remainder of the campaign. Failure will mean dire consequences for all gangs that participated in the uprising against order.

## Pit Brawl

During Downtime, if they don't fight the Enforcers, players can each send a Champion to fight in an Enforcer-sponsored Pit Brawl for the entertainment of the rest of the Underhive! The winning gangs will be rewarded, with the top gang receiving several weeks of reprieve from taxes.

# CAMPAIGN END
