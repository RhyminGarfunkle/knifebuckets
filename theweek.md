# THE WEEK

The campaign is divided into "Weeks". Unlike traditional campaigns, these are not real-world weeks, but in-game weeks. Depending on how long battles last, it may take several gaming sessions to fully resolve a week.

# WEEK SETUP

At the beginning of the week, a number of **Leads** are generated, equal to half the number of players (rounded up). To generate leads, all players roll off. The highest roller gets the first **lead**, the second highest the second, etc.

Each player starts the week with one **Challenge**, including players with Leads. If a player doesn't have a **Lead** this week, their only chance for a territory is to *challenge* someone.

# DRAW TERRITORY CARDS

Draw a number of Territory cards equal to the number of **leads plus one**, face up. These are the Territories available to be battled over this week.

# DRAW HIRED GUNS :id=hiredguns

Shuffle together all fighter cards for all active Hired Guns, except any Hired Guns marked as Dead. Draw a number of these cards equal to the **Number of Players minus one.** These are the Hired Guns available for this Week.

Hired Guns are added to a gang's crew during the [Pre-Battle](prebattle.md#hiredguns).

# PLAYING THE WEEK

The player with the current lead is called the **Knife** (because they're about to cut themselves off a piece!). The Knife selects the territory to be battled over.

If this Week is part of the Occupation phase, the Knife selects one of the remaining territories drawn at the start of the week. If this week is part of the Takeover phase, the Knife either selects one of the territories drawn at the start of the week, *or* selects a Territory currently controlled by another Gang.

After the Knife **picks a Territory**, any player who has a *Challenge* may spend it to challenge the Knife for control of that territory. All players with a *Challenge* to spend declare if they wish to fight over the territory or not - if no players challenge, the the Knife immediately takes the territory and either the next player with a Lead becomes the new Knife and selects a territory, or the week ends if there are no more Leads. If one or more players wish to fight over the territory, those players lose their *Challenge* and engage in a Battle to determine who takes control of the territory!

If it's currently the **Takeover phase,** (that is, if it's week 7 or later in the campaign) and the Knife selected a territory already held by another player, the player who currently controls the selected Territory does not need to spend a *Challenge* to participate in the battle for control over that Territory.

The scenario to be played is determined as part of the [Pre-Battle Sequence.](prebattle.md)

If any gang participating in the battle is in **Debt**, pick and set up a scenario as usual. After the entire first round is played, implement the [Enforcer Intervention rules](enforcers.md).

When the battle is over, whoever was the **Victor** (according to the rules of the Scenario) receives the territory. Unless otherwise specified by the scenario, if there was no single victor, the territory does not change hands.

After each battle, victorious gangs may take captives, and critical injuries are treated. Other post-battle actions occur at the End of the Week. See the Post-Battle rules for details.

If there are any more players with leads, they become **the Knife** and select the next territory to be battled over.

Once all Leads have been played, if any gang members have been taken Captive, rescue attempts may be mounted. Then, the week ends, and the [End of Week](endofweek.md) sequence is followed.

> **EXAMPLE WEEK**
>
>Judy, Steve, Marco, and Emilia are playing a Knifebuckets campaign. Because there are four players, two **Leads** are generated, and all players roll off to get these Leads.
>
> Marco and Emilia win the roll-off. Emilia had the overall highest roll, so she gets the **first Lead.** Marco gets the **Second Lead.**
>
> Because there are two leads, three Territory cards are drawn. Emilia has the first Lead, so she becomes **the Knife** and gets to select which territory will be first battled over. She selects the Mine Workings. All players have challenges, and Steve and Marco decide to spend theirs here. All three of them will engage in a battle for control of the Territory, and the winner will take the Mine Workings.
>
> Once that battle is fully resolved, Marco has the second Lead of the week. He decides he will attempt to take over the Gambling Den. Because Steve already spent his Challenge, he cannot participate in this battle. Emilia may participate, because she still has a Challenge - she participated in the first battle as the Knife, not a Challenger - but chooses not to. Judy spends her Challenge, so she and Marco battle for control of the Gambling Den.
>
> Because there are only two leads, once that second battle is complete, the week is over. Unless someone wishes to rescue a captured gang member, the [End of Week](endofweek.md) begins.

> The maximum number of gangs that can participate in a battle over territory is the total number of players minus one. The player(s) not participating in the battle act as Arbitrator, and may sometimes play an additional non-gang faction in the battle.
>
> If all four players wish to participate in a battle over a territory, give preference to players who don't have a Lead. This helps ensure all players get to fight in at least one battle per week.

> Generally, players who do not have a Lead for the week may only participate in one battle, the one they spend their Challenge on. Players with a Lead may participate in two battles, one they pick as the Knife, and another they spend a Challenge on.


# TAKEOVER

At the start of Week 7, immediately after Downtime, the **Takeover** phase of the campaign begins. Takeover plays much like the Occupation phase, with the following change:
- During Takeover, three Territory cards are drawn at the start of the week, but players are not limited to battling over these - **the Knife** may pick any territory already claimed by another player!

## Captive Recovery

If one player has **Captured** another player's fighter(s), at the end of the week (after all Territories have been battled over, but before performing the End of Week actions) the captured fighter's gang (Rescuer) may challenge the capturing gang (Captor). **The Rescuer does not need a Challenge to do this.**

If the Captor **declines,** the hostage is immediately returned with no further effects. If the Captor **accepts,** the Rescuer and Captor play the **Rescue Mission** scenario. If the Rescuer refuses to challenge, the Captor may do with their Captive as they please during the End of Week (options include selling the fighter, putting them to work in a territory, or permanently maiming the fighter).
â€‹ 
It's rare that gangs get so desperate that they ask another for help, but captive rescue is one of those times. A gang may hire another gang to help and enter into a [Formal Alliance](diplomacy.md#formal) with them for the duration of the Rescue mission. They may negotiate the payment between them.

> Payment for help with a hostage rescue may include credits, territories, weapons and wargear, or even real-world rewards outside the game!

If a single gang has captives from multiple other gangs, those gangs may work together to rescue their fighters. If all Rescuers agree, they may form a [Formal Alliance](diplomacy.md#formal) that lasts for the single scenario.
