# Special Scenario Rules

Some scenarios have special rules associated with them, or players may have special abilities to allow them to modify the rules of the game. 

# Pitch Black

## Overview

Pitch Black!  The power has been cut, and the map is shrouded in darkness. Without special equipment, fighters will struggle to see and attack each other.

## Tokens and Conditions

When the map is Pitch Black, all fighters are either **Hidden** or **Revealed**. As soon as the map becomes Pitch Black, all fighters are considered Hidden, except any fighters subject to the **Blaze** condition. As long as the map is Pitch Black, any fighter that doesn't have a **Revealed Token** is considered Hidden.

If a fighter has a Revealed token on activation, they immediately lose it (and become Hidden again) unless they're subject to the Blaze condition.

## When the map is Pitch Black...
​ 
Fighters **may not target a Hidden enemy more than 3 inches away** with a Ranged Attack or Charge. 
  
All weapons have a **Long range** of 12 inches. If a weapon's **Short range** is greater than 12 inches, it is reduced to 12. If the target is **Revealed**, Pitch Black rules do not apply - you may use the weapon's usual stats, and may ignore any Hidden enemies more than 3 inches away when determining Target Priority. 

All **blast attacks** not targeting a Fighter automatically Scatter, regardless of the hit roll.

If a fighter attacks with a **Template weapon,** and no target under the template is within **3 inches of the fighter or Revealed,** make an **Int check** for the attacking fighter. On a failed check, roll a Scatter dice, and place the template so it extends from the attacking fighter's base in the direction of the Scatter arrow, before resolving the attack as usual. Otherwise, place the template according to usual Flame Template rules.

Fighters receive a **Revealed marker** when they make a ranged attack with a **non-Silent weapon**, or any attack with a Power weapon.

If a fighter has the **Blaze** condition, they are considered Revealed for as long as the condition lasts. No Hidden rules apply to this fighter. If they put the fire out, they do not lose their Revealed token until their next activation. 
​ 
When a fighter with the **Blaze** condition moves, trace their entire movement path with a **3" blast template**. Any fighters under the template become Revealed until their next activation.

The penalties against targeting Hidden fighters and automatic scatters **do not apply** to a fighter has an **item** that mitigates the effects of Pitch Darkness, such as Photogoggles (the long range limitation still applies, unless targeting a Revealed fighter). A **weapon accessory** (like an Infrasight) only mitigates the effects when attacking with that specific weapon. A fighter with a **Photo-Lumen** may *choose* to mitigate Pitch Black effects during their activation - the controlling player must announce this at the start of Activation. If they do this, they immediately become **Revealed**.

Finally, if the map is Pitch Black, that means the power has been cut - any terrain features that rely on power (Terminals, elevators, locked doors, etc) cannot be operated. Terrain may still be activated in ways that don't require power - **Unlocked Doors** may be opened, and **Locked Doors** may be **Forced,** for example.

# Sneak Attack

## Overview

Certain scenarios use **Sneak Attack** rules. These rules allow one side to attempt to infiltrate the battlefield before proper combat starts, or even complete their mission undetected, while the other side attempts to spot them and raise the Alarm.

Once the alarm is raised, the Sneak Attack rules no longer apply and the battle proceeds as usual.

## When Sneak Attack is in effect...
​ 
**The Attacker** always has priority.

**The Defender** may only activate as many fighters as there are Attackers. Once the Attacker has activated all their fighters, the Defender activates one final fighter, then the round ends as though all players had activated all their fighters.

At the **beginning of the round,** the Defender rolls 1d6. This is the **maximum movement** for all Defending fighters for **this round.** If a fighter's Movement stat is less that this, they may only move as much as their Movement stat. If the [Alarm is Raised](#alarmraised) this round, this movement maximum no longer applied.

The Defending gang does not activate fighters as usual. Instead, when activating, do the following:

1. Choose a fighter with a Ready marker and remove it.
2. Make an **initiative check.** If passed, roll a Scatter dice - you may choose to change the fighter's facing to match the direction on the dice.
3. Attempt to **[Spot Attackers](#spotattackers)**.
4. Make one **Move (Simple)** action with the fighter, choose their facing, and again attempt to [Spot Attackers](#spotattackers).

> ### "This isn't the bathroom..."
If a Defender gets into base-to-base contact with an Attacker during the Defender's activation and the alarm still hasn't been raised, the Attacker will try to **play it cool.** Do not attempt to Spot the Attacker. Instead, make an Int check for the Defending fighter, adding 4 to the dice result.
>
>If failed, or a natural 2, immediately end the Defender's activation. The Attacker may either make a **Move (Simple)** action ending at least 1 inch from any enemy, or make a **Fight (Basic)** action. Note that the **Fight** action may end with the [alarm being raised](#alarmraised) if the Attacker isn't taken out.
>
>Otherwise, the Alarm is raised, the Defender immediately becomes **engaged** with the Attacker, and the Defender may immediately take their second action.

## Alarm is Raised :id=alarmraised

Sneak Attack remains in effect until the **Alarm is raised**. This can happen when an attacker is spotted, or when any of the following happens:
- A Defender is attacked and the attack doesn't end with the Defender being Seriously Injured or Out of Action
- A round ends with a Defender being Seriously Injured. This means if one Attacker attacks a Defender and seriously injures them but doesn't put them Out of Action, a second Attacker may finish the job without raising the Alarm.
- Any ranged weapon without the Silent trait is used by the Defenders
- The Attackers use a Tactics Card

If the alarm is raised, sneak attack rules are no longer in effect and play proceeds as normal. If the alarm is raised during a Defending fighter's **first action** they may take a second action during their activation.

Certain special actions may occur after the alarm is raised - for example, the Defender may be able to deploy Reinforcements. Refer to the scenario for details.

## Spotting Attackers :id=spotattackers

Defenders check if they spot an Attacker during steps 2 and 4 of the Sneak Attack Defender Activation, when an Attacker fighter fails the Distraction initiative check, or any time an Attacker's movement path puts it through a Defender's **Field of View**.

> When an Attacker's **movement path** puts it through the Defender's Field of View, if the Attacker ended its movement **inside the Defender's FOV,** make the check with the Attacker at the final location.
>
>If the Attacker finished the Move action **outside the Defender's FOV** the **Defender** selects a position along the movement path, makes the check with the Attacker's figure at that location, then replaces the Attacker at its final position once the check is complete.

A Defending fighter may spot an Attacker if the Attacker is within 12 inches of the Defender, and the Defender could target that Attacker with a standard Shoot action.

If a Defending fighter could potentially spot an Attacker, make an Intelligence check for the Defending Fighter with the following modifiers based on the Attacker's status: 
- No cover: +3
- Defender is less than 3 inches from Attacker: +3
- Full Cover: -3
- Pinned: -2
- The check was triggered by the Attacker moving through the Defenders FOV: +1

All modifiers are cumulative.

Natural 2s always fail.

If the check is passed, the [Alarm is raised](#alarmraised). If a Defender spots an Attacker immediately after their Move action, they may immediately take a second action as usual.

## Distractions

Once per round, the Attacker may have any Fighter make the following action:

>**Distraction (Basic)**: Toss a rock, bottle, or other convenient object to throw a pursuer off the scent. Select a Defender within six inches of this Attacker that has a Ready marker, then make an initiative check, adding +1 if this fighter is impossible for any Defender to spot. If passed, the Attacking player turns the Defender to face any chosen direction and removes their ready marker. If failed: 
- Turn the Defender to face the Attacker, and test to see if the [Attacker is spotted](#spotattackers).
- Have the Defending player make a Move (Simple) action with that Defender.
- Have the Defending fighter directly face the Attacker and test again to see if the [Attacker is spotted](#spotattackers). Do not remove the Defender's ready marker.
