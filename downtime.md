# DOWNTIME

Between the **Occupation** and **Takeover** phases is **Downtime**. Downtime gives all gangs a chance to rest and recuperate, and allows for a special scenario to be played.

# R AND R

The final Occupation **End of Week** is concluded as usual. After the Underdog status is calculated, do not immediately begin a new Week. Instead:
1. All fighters in **Recovery** are immediately restored.
2. All captives, including those held by Enforcers, are returned to their gangs. 
3. All fighters receive **D6** experience. If this makes any fighter eligible for an Advancement, they may immediately receive it.
4. All gangs with an **Underdog (X)** status receive 150 x **(X)**. These credits must be spent immediately on fighters and equipment - any unspent credits are lost, not placed in the gang's stash. These credits may be supplemented by credits in the stash, which are not lost. Leaders, Champions, Specialists, and Juves may make a usual Trade action to spend these credits.

Once these steps have been completed, players may engage in a special scenario!

# SPECIAL DOWNTIME SCENARIO

If they wish, players may band together to take down the Enforcers once and for all - any number of players may band together in a Formal Alliance and play the [Precinct Assault](scenarios.md#scenPrecinctAssault) scenario (one player must be the Enforcers in this case - if all players in the campaign wish to enter the Alliance, roll off to see who will control the Enforcers).

If no players wish to engage the Enforcers, players play the special [Pit Brawl](scenarios.md#scenPitBrawl) scenario. Participation in this battle isn't mandatory, but if only one player participates they win by default.

# DOWNTIME END OF WEEK

After the Downtime scenario, there is a modified End of Week - players **do not** collect any Territory resources or rewards, but are able to take all other usual End of Week actions, such as advancing fighters and purchasing equipment.

Then, the **Takeover** phase of the campaign begins - immediately begin a new Week.

> Fighters that went into Recovery during the Special Downtime Scenario remain in recovery as usual.
