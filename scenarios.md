# Scenarios

Different battles will be fought using different scenarios. The scenario dictates things like how fighters are deployed, and what each gang's goal is, along with any special rules unique to the scenario.

# Scenarios Explained

Many scenarios have details like "standard deployment" or "standard tactics card draw." Those standards are defined here. Bear in mind that some scenarios may have additions to these rules, or disregard them entirely - these rules only apply when that section of the scenario description refers to the "standard".

### Attackers and Defenders

In battles over unclaimed territories, the Defender will be the Knife. All other gangs are considered Attackers.

Otherwise, the scenario will describe which gangs are Attackers and which are Defenders.

Bear in mind that just because multiple gangs are all considered Attackers, doesn't mean that those gangs are allied in any way! Attacker and Defender are simply shorthand ways to assign different roles and goals to different players.

> For example, in the scenario "The Trap", the Defender deploys in the center of the board, while all Attacking gangs deploy along the edge. While Attacking gangs will likely run into the Defender first, they can be just as hostile to other Attacking gangs from the mission start - in the end, only one gang can be victorious!


### Battlefield :id=standardbattlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The specifics of the battlefield are laid out in the terrain guide. The battlefield area is usually either a 3x3 or 2x2 foot square.

### Crews :id=standardcrews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Crews are usually selected via Custom or Random methods.

#### Custom (X)<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Select up to **(X)** number of fighters from your gang who are not in recovery, captured, or otherwise unable to participate in battle.

#### Random (X)<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Create a list of fighters from your gang who are not in recovery, captured, or otherwise unable to fight. Select up to **(X)** number of these fighters to participate in this battle.

### Tactics Cards :id=standardtactics<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
A standard draw is 2 tactics cards during the Occupation phase, 3 tactics cards during Takeover phase.

Tactics cards drawn for a battle are discarded, even if they were not played during the battle. They may not be drawn again until a new deck is created at the start of a new week.

### Deployment :id=standarddeployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

For a standard deployment with four or fewer players, roll off to determine the order in which players pick their corner of the map. Players then roll off again to determine the order in which they will place fighters.

The **Deployment Zone** is a 1 foot square wedged into the player's deployment corner. All fighters must be deployed with their base entirely inside the deployment zone. Fighters cannot be deployed on special terrain - that is, terrain that causes special effects when entered, or is more difficult to move through than regular terrain.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This section dictates the goals of the gangs participating in the battle. Objectives will often be asymmetric, with different gangs attempting to accomplish different goals.

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Unless otherwise stated, a battle ends when only one gang remains on the board, or no gangs remain on the board. The battle can only end when the current activation or end phase is fully resolved.

>For example, if all gangs bottled out during the end phase, the game couldn't end until every fighter from every gang checked to see if they fled.
>
>This extends to more outlandish possibilities, like all remaining fighters getting caught under the same blast - the game couldn't end until every fighter involved resolved the hit.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Generally the gang with fighters on the board when the battle ends is the victor. If there are no fighters on the board, the battle ends in a draw.

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If the battle was fought over a territory, the victorious gang will receive that, plus any other rewards listed here. There may be smaller rewards for draws or non-victorious players.

### Experience<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Any additional experience doled out to winners or losers of the scenario.

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Different amounts of reputation will be given to the winners, or to all gangs in the event of a draw. Bottling out usually results in a loss of Reputation.

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Many scenarios will have special rules. These will be listed and described in this final section.


# Scenario List<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

# Invasion - the First Battle :id=scenStandOff

All players participate in the first battle! Make it out with as many Loot Caskets as you can grab, to start your campaign off on a solid footing.

In this battle a number of crates/caskets are placed on the board. Some contain credits, while others contain equipment, potentially rare and valuable! Each gang's main goal is to carry off as many caskets as possible. If you can take down a few opposing members on the way all the better, but remember: if you get too caught up in the fighting, someone else could steal your crates right out from under you!

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Standard setup with the Slums type terrain.

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Custom Selection (7)

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard.](#standardtactics) Since there has not yet been an End of Week to create decks of Tactics Cards, players may immediately create a deck of six of more cards from their starting options, then draw two from that.

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard.](#standarddeployment)

Before any player deploys their fighters, players must first place the Ammo and Loot caskets that they will fight over on the board.

To determine the number of Ammo and Loot Caskets to place, multiply the number of players in the campaign by three, then divide that number by two (rounding down). Place that many of each type of casket.

> For example, if you have four players, you would use (4 players * 3) / 2 = 6 Ammo and 6 Loot caskets.

Before deploying, but after placing terrain, players will take turns placing the Loot Caskets, one at a time, on the map. Caskets may be placed anywhere more than ten inches from any deployment point, anywhere a fighter may be placed. After all Loot Caskets are placed, players will similarly place all Credit Caskets.

Once all crates/caskets are placed, players deploy their fighters as usual.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

There are no winners or losers in this first battle! Each gang is just trying to claim as much loot as possible for themselves. However, if two gangs have their eye on the same crate, there might not be a peaceful way to reconcile their differences...

Claim a crate by having a fighter carry it to within 1 inch of any edge of the map. The fighter no longer participates in this battle (but does not count as OOA for bottle checks) and the controlling player takes the casket, to be processed after the battle.

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The battle ends immediately when there is only a single gang left on the board. That gang automatically claims all caskets within 2 inches of any fighters they have left on the board. 

All caskets more than 2 inches from a fighter are lost. There's no time to grab them - the Enforcers have been watching the battle, and now that the heat's died down, they're finally moving in to "keep the peace"!

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

There is no victor in this scenario. Alternatively, every player is a winner in this scenario!

### Rewards :id=invasionrewards <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

For each Credit casket claimed, the gang gains 2D6x10 credits. 
  
For each Loot casket, roll on the [Ammo Crate Table](tables.md#crates), and add the resulting equipment to your gang's Stash.

### Experience<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

All fighters that claimed a casket for their gang (by carrying it to the edge of the map) gain D3 XP, in addition to the usual participation XP (given out in the Post-Battle phase)

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

All gangs gain 1 reputation for each casket their gang claimed.

# The Trap :id=scenTheTrap

A gang caught unawares tries to stand their ground!

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard](#standardbattlefield)

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

All gangs use the Custom Selection (8). If more than 2 gangs are fighting, reduce each **attacking** gang's crew count by 2 for every gang over 2, to a minimum of 5.
> Example: There are three gangs participating in the battle. The Defender uses Custom Selection (8), while all Attacker gangs use Custom Selection (6). If there were four or more gangs, all attackers would use Custom Selection (5).

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard.](#standardtactics)

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The **defender** deploys four of their fighters within 3 inches of the center of the battlefield, then deploys all remaining fighters within 2 inches of already deployed fighters.

> If using terrain where the board center is not a valid deployment area, such as some Towers or Sump Sea configurations, locate the spot nearest the center where at least four of the Defender's fighters could deploy within 3 inches of.

Attackers deploy their fighters within 6 inches of any edge of the battlefield, and 6 inches from any enemy fighter. If there is more than one Attacker, divide the perimeter of the board so that each gang gets an equally sized, continuous section to deploy on. Multiple attackers take turns placing fighters one at a time.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Be the last gang standing on the board!

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If at any point only one gang has fighters left on the battlefield, or no gang has fighters remaining, the battle immediately ends.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The gang with fighters remaining is the victor. If there are no fighters left, the battle ends in a draw.

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The victorious gang receives D6x10 credits, in addition to the territory that was being fought over. The loser(s) receives D3x5 credits.

In the case of a draw, all gangs receive D6x5 credits (rolled once, all gangs receive the same amount).

### Experience<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The leader of the victorious gang receives D3 XP, regardless of whether or not they participated. In the case of a draw, no leader gets this bonus.

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

- The Victor gang receives 3 Reputation.
- If the battle ended in a draw, every gang that participated receives 2 Reputation.
- If any gang bottled out, they *lose* 1 Reputation.

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

In the first round, the **Defender does not roll for priority as usual**. Instead, they select their fighter with the highest Leadership stat in their Crew, and make an Initiative check for them. If passed, they have highest priority - otherwise, they have lowest priority. All Attackers roll as usual. 

During the first round, roll a **Cool Check** for each fighter (attacker and defender alike) on activation. If the check is failed, the fighter can only make one action this round, instead of the usual two.



# Ambush! :id=scenAmbush

A gang is caught outgunned and unawares! Sometimes running away is the best option.

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard](#standardbattlefield), with the following caveats: 
- No terrain, except scatter terrain (barrels, barricades, etc), may be placed within 8 inches of the center of the battlefield.
- If using Tower or Sump Sea terrain, terrain may be used to create a clear platform in the center of the battlefield for the Defender to deploy on. If using Tower terrain, make this platform as high as possible.

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The Defender uses Random Selection (D3 + 5). 

Attackers use Custom Selection (10). If there are multiple attackers, all attackers reduce their crew count by 2 for each additional attacker, to a minimum of 6.

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard.](#standardtactics)

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
The Defender rolls a D6 for each fighter, one at a time. On a 1-5, they place their fighter within 6 inches of the center of the battlefield, on the cleared area created during Setup. On a 6, they set aside the fighter to be placed later.

Then, all Attackers deploy their fighters.

If there is one Attacker, the entire battlefield is their deployment zone. The Attacker may place their fighters anywhere, observing the following:  
- Attacking fighters must be at least 12 inches from any Defenders
- Attacking fighters may be 6 inches from Defenders, if there is no line of sight to any Defender

If there are multiple Attackers, divide the board such that each Attacker's deployment zone encompasses an equal share of the Defender's deployment zone, e.g. for two Attackers divide the board in half down the middle. Attackers take turns placing their fighters one at a time, following the rules above, with the following additional rule:  
- Attacking fighters must be at least 6 inches from enemy Attackers

Finally, after all Attackers have set up, the defender places any fighters they set aside. These fighters can be set up anywhere on the battlefield, as long as they're at least 1 inch from an enemy fighter, and 8 inches from the edge of the battlefield.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The Defender wants to **escape the battlefield.** Any Defending fighter that is within 1 inch of the edge of the board during the end phase may Escape, even if they are Pinned or Seriously Injured. Escaping does not cost an action. An Escaping fighter is removed from the battlefield, and they count as being taken Out of Action for bottle tests. Seriously Injured fighters that escape still participate in the "Resolve Serious Injuries" step of the post-battle sequence.

The Attackers want to **prevent the Defender's escape** by taking down as many as possible! If they can knock out some other rivals while they're at it, all the better. 

>If using the Tower terrain, fighters may Escape when they are standing on the lowest level of a tower *and* more than 6 inches from the board center.

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

As soon as there are no more non-Seriously Injured Defenders on the battlefield, the battle immediately ends. In the unlikely event that the Defender is the only gang left, the battle immediately ends.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If the number of defending fighters who Escaped is greater than the number of defending fighters who went Out of Action or Fled, or the Defender is the only gang left on the board, the Defenders win. Otherwise:
- If there is only one Attacker, they win.
- If there are multiple Attackers, the gang who took the most fighters Out of Action (including fighters from other Attacking gangs) wins. If there is a tie, the battle continues until one gang claims the most enemy fighters *or* all other Attacking gangs bottle out - the remaining gang is victorious.

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The victorious gang receives D6x10 credits, in addition to the territory that was being fought over. The loser(s) receives D3x5 credits.

In the case of a draw, all gangs receive D6x5 credits (rolled once, all gangs receive the same amount).

### Experience<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Each Defending fighter who managed to Escape receives D3 XP. 

If no Defenders escaped, each Attacking gang's Leader receives D3 XP (including leaders of non-victorious Attacking gangs)

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

- The Victor gang receives 3 Reputation.
- If the battle ended in a draw, every gang that participated receives 2 Reputation.
- If any gang bottled out, they *lose* 1 Reputation.

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The attackers take Priority in the first round of the game. If there are multiple attackers, they roll off for priority, but the Defender goes last. 

If there is only one Attacker, they roll 1D3. They may activate that many fighters before the Defender makes any activations. 

During the first round, make a Cool check for every fighter (Attacker and Defender alike) on activation. If the check is failed, that fighter can only make one action instead of two. 

If using Tower terrain, Defending fighters that Plummet **automatically fail** their initiative check.


# Escort Mission :id=scenEscortMission

Some fancypants rich kid playing Ganger made some enemies and wants to go home. Their parents have contracted a gang to escort them back Uphive.

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard](#standardbattlefield)

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Defenders use Custom Selection (6). Additionally, the Defender receives a special Fighter, the **Uphiver.**

Attackers use Random Selection (7). Reduce all Attacker crew sizes by 2 for each additional Attacking gang, to a minimum of 4.

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard.](#standardtactics)

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard.](#standarddeployment) Standard. If given the choice between a corner and non-corner deployment zone, the Defender must choose a corner. If using **Tower rules**, the Defending gang deploys on the bottom-most level of one tower. 

Before deploying, but after all gangs pick deployment zones, the Defender selects an edge of the board not touching their Deployment Zone to be the Extraction Zone. If using Tower rules, the attacker selects a tower the Defender did not deploy on - the highest level of this tower is the Extraction Zone.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The Defenders need to **get the Uphiver to safety**. If the Uphiver is ever within one inch of the Extraction Zone they are safely **extracted** - remove them from the board.

The Attackers have been hired to make sure this does not happen. Their goal is to **kill the Uphiver.**

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

When the **Uphiver** is taken Out of Action, the battle immediately ends.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If the Uphiver has been extracted, the **Defenders win**, even if every other Defending fighter bottled out or went Out of Action.

If the Uphiver has been taken Out of Action, the **Attackers win** - if there are multiple attackers, the gang that caused the Out of Action wins. Otherwise, it's a draw between all Attackers with fighters on the board.

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The victorious gang receives D6x10 credits, in addition to the territory that was being fought over. The loser(s) receives D3x5 credits.

In the case of a draw, all attacking gangs receive D6x5 credits (rolled once, all gangs receive the same amount).

### Experience<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The leader of the victorious gang receives D3 XP, regardless of whether or not they participated. In the case of a draw, no leader gets this bonus.

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

- The Victor gang receives 3 Reputation.
- If the battle ended in a draw, every gang that participated receives 2 Reputation.
- If any gang bottled out, they *lose* 1 Reputation.

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**The Uphiver:** This is the rich kid who's been playing ganger in the Underhive for the last few weeks. Nobody's surprised that they've gotten themselves into more trouble than they can handle, and their fancy parents are paying a fancy sum to escort them home. What is surprising is the matching bounty to make sure they never get out - their trouble must have been pretty deep indeed!

The Uphiver only leaves the battlefield if they're Extracted or killed. Even if the Defending gang bottles out and all gang members retreat, the Uphiver remains on the board and in the Defending player's control.

The Uphiver has the following stats:

| WS | BS | M | S | T | I  | A  | Ld | Cl | Wl | Int | W |
|----|----|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|-----|---|
| 5+ | 4+ | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4+ | 1+ | 8+ | 6+ | 7+ | 7+  | 2 |

The Uphiver is equipped with a laspistol, mesh armor, and a displacer field. They have the Spring Up skill.


# Gang Moot :id=scenGangMoot

Surely we can solve our differences without resorting to bloodshed?

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard](#standardbattlefield)

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

All gangs pick their **Leader's** fighter card for inclusion. If their Leader isn't available for combat, pick the fighter that would take over as Leader if the Leader were to die (see the Gang Composition rules) - that fighter will be referred to as the Leader in this scenario, for convenience.

After selecting their leader, all gangs use **Random Selection (D3 + 3)** to select the rest of their crew.

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard.](#standardtactics)

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Players take turns placing their **Leaders** within three inches of the center of the board. Then, each player takes turns placing their remaining crew anywhere on the board, observing the following:

- Fighters must be placed at least **12 inches** from any leader
- Fighters must be at least **4 inches** from any other fighter (friend or foe)

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Be the last gang standing on the board!

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If at any point only one gang has fighters left on the battlefield, or no gang has fighters remaining, the battle immediately ends.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

One gang wins if, at the end of the battle, their Leader is still on the battlefield and not Seriously Injured. Otherwise, the result is a draw between all gangs.

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The victorious gang receives D6x10 credits, in addition to the territory that was being fought over. The loser(s) receives D3x5 credits.

In the case of a draw, all gangs receive D6x5 credits (rolled once, all gangs receive the same amount).

### Experience<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The leader of the victorious gang receives D3+3 XP, regardless of whether or not they participated. In the case of a draw, no leader gets this bonus.

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

- The Victor gang receives 3 Reputation.
- If the battle ended in a draw, every gang that participated receives 2 Reputation.
- If any gang bottled out, they *lose* 1 Reputation.

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**PARLAY:** At the start of the first round, only the Leaders are Ready. All other fighters are unaware that this meeting is about to go south.

When a fighter makes a Shoot action, unless their weapon has the **Silent trait**, all other fighters within 12 inches that are not (and have not been) Ready make an **Intelligence test**. Those that pass immediately become Ready. Fighters targeted by attacks also become Ready, assuming they survive (and haven't already been activated this round). In the End phase, each player may move their fighters that **never received** a Ready marker 6 inches in any direction - from then on, all fighters receive Ready markers at the start of each round as usual.

**FEELIN' FROGGY:** In the first round, before activating any fighters, all players take turns in priority order making **Cool checks** for their leaders. The first player to **fail** this cool check gets to activate their Leader - play then proceeds in Priority order, as usual.


# Rescue Mission :id=scenRescueMission

One of your fighters was taken captive - it's time to take them back! This scenario can only be played if another player's gang has taken captives. This mission uses the special Sneak Attack rules, the gang rescuing captives are always the attacker.

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

[Standard](#standardbattlefield). The Defender may select the terrain type, and has the Home Turf advantage.

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Defenders use Custom Selection (5). Leaders and Champions **cannot** be part of the Defender's starting crew. All fighters not selected for battle (and not in recovery, captive, or unable to fight for some other reason) are put to the side as Reinforcements. 

Attackers use Custom Selection (5). If multiple players have entered a Formal Alliance for this battle, they may collectively select up to 6 total fighters, split between gangs as they choose.

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The Defender draws one Tactics card. The Attacker may draw the usual two.

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

First, the Defender places the Captive anywhere on the board, then all Fighters within 12 inches of the Captive.

Then, Attackers place each of their fighters anywhere within 3 inches of **any edge** of the battlefield. If using Tower terrain, place fighters anywhere on the **lowest level** of the battlefield.

The Defender selects one edge of the board (or one lowest level of **one** tower) to be their Reinforcement Zone. Each turn after the alarm is raised, the Defender will draw D3 fighter cards from their Reinforcements deck and place them with 2 inches of their Reinforcement Zone.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The Attackers want to **rescue their Captive** (see the Special Rule), preferably without the Defender even noticing, then get out of there. Any Attacking fighter within 2 inches of any edge of the battlefield (or touching the lowest level of a tower) may leave the battle. These fighters do not count as having gone Out of Action for purposes of Bottle Tests or similar.

The Defender wants to catch the Attackers in the act, raise the alarm, and drive them off - maybe even take another captive in the process!

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If at any point only one gang has fighters left on the battlefield, or no gang has fighters remaining, the battle immediately ends.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If all Captives were freed and left the battlefield, the Attackers win. If no Captives left the battlefield, the Defender wins. Otherwise, it's a draw.

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

No material rewards.

If the Defenders won, they add **+3** to the roll to see if the take any Captives. Additionally, any fighters that were Captive but didn't escape (for example, the were taken Out of Action or their gang bottled out) are automatically re-taken as captives (serious injury dice are not rolled for them in this case)

### Experience<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

- Each Captive that was successfully rescued receives 2D3 XP.
- If all Captives were successfully rescued, the leader of the Attacking gang(s) receives D3 XP (even if they didn't take part in the battle)

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

- For each rescued captive, the Attacker gains 2 Rep and the Defender loses 1 Rep.
- For each captive that wasn't rescued, the Defender gains 1 Rep.
- If any gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**Captive Fighters:** Captive fighters **never** gain Ready markers, and cannot be activated or targeted by any player. 

In the End phase of each round, the attacking player may declare that one of more Captives will attempt to **escape their bonds.** For each Captive that does so, roll 2D6 and add the Captive's Strength. On a **13+**, they break loose and are no longer Captive; on a 6 or less, they injure themselves in the attempt and suffer a **Flesh Wound**. 

Non-Captive Attacking fighters may make the following action: 

**FREE CAPTIVE (BASIC)** : Pick a Captive within 1 inch of this fighter. Roll 2D6 and add the **Str or Int** of this fighter and that captive (use the same stat for both), adding 2 for each additional non-captive friendly fighter within 1 inch of the captive. On a 12+, the Captive is  freed, and the fighter that took this action receives D3 XP.

A captive that is Freed gains a Ready marker at the start of the next round and can be activated as usual. They also have access to all equipment on their Fighter Card (assume their rescuer brought it with them).


# (Downtime) Precinct Assault :id=scenPrecinctAssault

Time to put some representation to that taxation!

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

A special mix of Slums and Zone Mortalis terrain.

Start by laying out a 3x3 foot play area.

Anywhere inside this, the Enforcer player will designate a 2x2 foot square as the Precinct. Enclose this area with ZM walls. There must be at least one large door and three small doors leading inside the precinct, with not more than 16 inches between them (measured along the perimeter of the walls).

Then, the Enforcer populates the interior of the Precinct with terrain. Include one room designated as the Cells, at least 4x4 inches of floor space, blocked off from the rest of the precinct with a door, with a terminal outside. The remaining design of the interior, including any doors, scatter terrain, and terminals, is wholly up to the Enforcer player, but all floor space must be accessible. Finally, place 2 ammo caches inside the Precinct, plus one special Global Control Terminal anywhere inside the precinct at least 3 inches from any door.

The rest of the board will use the Slums rules for placing terrain. The Gang players place all slums terrain as they see fit.

Inside the Precinct, Zone Mortalis rules apply. The walls cannot be climbed over, and from the outside, treat the walls as if they extend infinitely high.

Finally, the Gangs may place two ductways across any Precinct walls that are not part of the Cells, and may remove all terminals connected to a single Door (excluding the door to the Cells).

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Allied gangs may field a total of 18 fighters, custom selection. Players may determine amongst themselves how many fighters each gang will take. Gang crews may not include Hired Guns or any other non-gang fighters.

Enforcers use all Enforcer fighters - this should be 13 fighters total, plus 3 Hardcase Cyber-Mastiffs.

Enforcers count as Defenders for all purposes in this scenario.

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Standard. Enforcers may use up to 4 generic Tactics cards in their deck, in addition to the standard Enforcer cards. Additionally, Enforcers receive one additional Tactics card, chosen from all available tactics cards instead of drawn.

Gangs may not use any Underdog cards in this scenario.

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

First, Gang players each select up to D3 fighters to be inside men - these fighters are placed inside the Precinct cells. Over the course of the battle they may attempt to bust out, assaulting the Precinct from within.

Then, the Enforcer places half their fighters (rounding up) anywhere inside the precinct.

Gangs take turns placing all their remaining fighters anywhere within 1 inch of the edge of the board, outside the precinct, and at least 6 inches from any exterior Precinct door.

Finally, Enforcers place all remaining fighters anywhere on the board, inside or outside the precinct.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Eliminate the other team!

Enforcer players play according to the [Enforcer rules](enforcers.md)*, as though all Gang players were **debtors.** The player controlling the Enforcers may be tempted to go easy on the Gang players, but remember, if they're successful they will receive massive rewards - rewards **you won't get any part of.** 

> *Ignore the "Arrests" enforcer rule. Enforcers are fighting for their lives, so roll permanent injuries as usual. If Enforcers win the scenario they will make arrests via the standard Captive post-battle rules, with the following modification: 
> - Instead of taking a single captive, subtract 11 from the final number result, and divide this by 2 (rounding up). Take that number of captives. For example, if the number of Possible Captives + Final Gang Fighters + 1d6 were 16, Enforcers would arrest 3 gang members. Evenly divide the arrests across all allied gangs, rolling off for remainders.

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The battle will automatically end in the end phase of round Eight, before recovery tests.

If at any point only one gang has fighters left on the battlefield, or no gang has fighters remaining, the battle immediately ends.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The last side remaining is the victor!

If the battle lasts until the end phase of round Eight and there are still Enforcers on the board, reinforcements have arrived! The battle automatically ends in victory for the Enforcers. Remove all gang players from the board - if any were Seriously Injured, they are automatically resolved as Out of Action in the post-battle sequence.

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

If the Gangs win, they receive rewards as described in ["I Fought the Law and... I Won!"](enforcers.md#iwon). Additionally, the Enforcers are no longer a factor in this campaign - they will collect no taxes, and will never show up in another scenario. 

If the Enforcers win, resolve as shown under ["I fought the Law and... the Law Won."](enforcers.md#lawwon)

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

>**Special Priority Order:** If there are three or more players allied against the Enforcers, Enforcers act between each gang player; turn order goes Enforcers, Player A, Enforcers, Player B, etc. This is to prevent the gang players from effectively having unlimited group activations between each Enforcer action, or the Enforcers having unlimited group activations after all Gang players have gone.

>**PRIORITY PREPARATION:** The Enforcers have priority each round. For the purposes of special cards or abilities that influence priority order, assume that the Enforcer player rolled a 6 for all priority checks.

>**JAILBREAK:** Gang fighters deployed inside the jail cell may attempt to break through the locked cell door to assault the Precinct from the inside. Fighters fighter in base contact with the door may attempt to hack it from inside by making an **"Access Terminal (Basic)"** action with a **-4 penalty instead of -2.** They may also attempt to open the door by forcing it, but this door is specially reinforced - **"Force Door (basic)"** requires a total score of **11** instead of 9.
>
>If the map goes **Pitch Black**, that means the power has been cut. In this circumstance the door cannot be hacked, but may be forced, requiring the **usual 9** score instead of 11.
>
>This door is just as hard to force open from outside, but using "Access Terminal" at the door's terminal is the usual action with **no additional penalty.**

>**ACCESS CODES:** Because the Enforcers are Defenders, they treat all Locked doors as Unlocked. If they use "Access Terminal" to open or close a door, their Int check has no penalty.

>**GLOBAL CONTROL TERMINAL:** Any Enforcer fighter may perform the following action if they're in base contact with the Global Control Terminal:
>- **DOOR ACCESS (Basic):** Open or close any one Precinct door, except the Cell door.
>
>Any Gang fighter may perform the following action if they're in base contact with the Global Control Terminal:
>- **DOOR HACK (Basic):** Perform an Int check with a -2 modifier. If successful, open or close any one Precinct door, including the Cell door.

>**FINAL STAND:** The Enforcers are making their final stand. They will **automatically pass all bottle checks** as long as there is a **Captain or Sergeant** (Palanite Enforcer/Subjugator Leader or Champion) on the board. Once all Captains or Sergeants have been defeated, the gang automatically bottles out, and remaining enforcers have a -2 to their bottle check cool tests.

> **FORTIFIED BASE:** The Precinct has been fortified and armored against incursions. Skills, tactics cards, or any other rule-modifying ability that allow for deployment outside the standard deployment zone, or outside the Deployment phase, may not be used to deploy any fighters inside the Precinct walls.



# (Downtime) Pit Brawl :id=scenPitBrawl

The Enforcers have organized a bit of friendly sport for a thirsty underhive!

### Battlefield<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Use ZM terrain to designate a roughly 24x24" area as the fighting pit. This pit cannot be escaped over the course of the battle. Each player places a single piece of solid terrain inside the pit, maintaining a 8x8 inch terrain-free area in the center, then each player places up to four pieces of scatter terrain anywhere inside the pit.

### Crews<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Each gang selects a single Champion.

### Tactics Cards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

No tactics cards. Additionally, any territory boons that provide an in-battle effect may not be used.

### Deployment<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Fighters are deployed equidistantly around the edge of the fighting pit.

### Objectives<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Take the other Champions out!

### Ending the Battle<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The fight ends when there is only a single Champion left.

### Victory<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The last gang standing is the victor. If there are no champions left, there is no victor!

### Rewards<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Each gang receives 20 credits for every fighter their champion took out. Additionally, the victorious gang owes no taxes for two weeks!

### Reputation<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Each gang receives 1 Reputation for participating, plus 2 additional Reputation if their gang survives to round 6.

### Special Rules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**IT'S ONLY A SCRATCH: Nobody** likes a quick fight, and Champions know they need to put on a grisly show. **Coup de Grace cannot be used** against other Champions. When rolling injury dice, **Flesh Wounds are ignored**, and **Seriously Injured counts as Flesh Wound**. When a fighter goes Out of Action, a Lasting Injury result is rolled, but the only negative effect that can be applied is Recovery. 
​ 
**EVEN THE FIELD:** No wargear besides armor and grenades may be used for the duration of the battle.
For the first two rounds, no ranged weapons or grenades may be used. In rounds three and four, grenades and unwieldy ranged weapons cannot be used. Round five and after, no weapon restrictions!

**ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?:** The crowd wants to see a brawl! If any fighter ends their activation more than 12 inches from another fighter, and less than six inches from a pit wall, some drunk will take a potshot at them: target that fighter with a BS4, Strength 3, Damage 1 ranged attack.

**SEND IN THE HOUNDS:** When the first two Champions are taken out of action, a **Cyber Mastiff** will be sent in to replace them. In the end phase after the champion went OOA, the player who controlled that Champion selects a Cyber Mastiff and places it anywhere along the edge of the pit. That player controls that Mastiff for the remainder of the battle, and may behave as they see fit, except that Mastiffs may not attack each other (consider all Mastiffs to be in a **Formal Alliance**)
