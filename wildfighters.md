# Wild Fighters

Most battles in a Knifebuckets require that at least one gang sits out the battle. The player who's gang isn't participating can still take part in the battle, however - they do this via Wild Fighters, fighters who aren't affiliated with a gang and exist to cause havoc or level the playing field, whatever the controlling player sees fit to do.

These fighters might be vigilante civilians, beat cops on patrol, bounty hunters looking for a score, stray beasts, or monsters from the freakiest depths of the Underhive!

Assume that all scenarios may contain Wild Fighters, unless it's specified that it doesn't.

The player controlling the Wild Fighters gains no benefit from the outcome of the battle. They're there to give the player who's sitting the game out something to do, and allow them to act as a tool to help even the playing field as they see fit. This doesn't mean they're required to target the strongest gang on the board - if someone wants to take out their personal enmity against another gang by swarming them with a pack of feral cyber-mastiffs, they're fully welcome to do so! Wild Fighters can be a force of karma or of luck, whichever the controlling player prefers.

If there is no extra player available to control the Wild Fighters, simply disregard them.

# Setup

If using Wild Fighters this scenario, the player controlling them rolls a d3 in secret, and adds 1 to the result. The Wild Fighters will deploy in that round, before the Roll for Priority. Do not roll to determine the Wild Fighters to be used until then, and do not tell the gang players which round the Wild Fighters deploy on until it's time to deploy.

> For example, the player(s) controlling the Wild Fighters roll a 2 on the d3. This means they will deploy on round 3. At the beginning of round 3, before the Roll for Priority, the Wild Fighter player(s) will roll on the Wild Fighter table and deploy their fighter as specified.

If deployment is specified to be near the map edge, but this is not possible due to the terrain (such as with the "Towers" terrain type), deploy fighters within the specified distance of anywhere that would be a reasonable entry point onto the map, following other deployment guidelines.

If there are multiple players sitting out the battle, distribute all Wild Fighters between them as close to evenly as possible. If there is an odd number or players otherwise cannot agree how to distribute them, simply roll off. If there is a single Wild Fighter, players may take turns controlling it.

# Activation

Players who control Wild Fighters participate in the **Roll for Priority** if they have fighters on the board, and take their turns in Priority Order.

Players may, but are **not required** to, activate any of their Wild Fighters on their turn. Because players controlling Wild Fighters usually have vastly fewer fighters under their control than Gang players do, they may choose to skip their turn when it comes to activate their Wild Fighters later in the round. Each player controlling Wild Fighters may only activate a single Wild Fighter on their turn, unless a fighter has an ability that allows them to activate more.

However, **as soon as all Gang Fighters have completed their activations,** the round immediately ends and proceeds directly to the End Phase. Any Wild Fighters who have not yet been activated **do not** get a chance to activate, even if the Wild Fighter player would have been next in Priority Order.

# The End of the Battle

If a scenario specifies that a battle ends "when only a single gang remains" or similar, the battle will still end if there is only one gang and Wild Fighters on the board. Wild Fighters are not a gang and in this case, the battle would immediately end and the last gang would be the winner. The Wild Fighters would not be counted in any sense when resolving the Post-Battle sequence.

# Other Rules

- Wild Fighters do not count towards the completion of any objectives.
- Unless otherwise specified, Wild Fighters do not grant experience for any actions taken against them.
- Wild Fighters cannot leave the battlefield by Fleeing.
- Wild Fighters do not need to make Nerve Tests because a friendly fighter went down nearby.
- Wild Fighters do not make Permanent Injury rolls when taken Out of Action. Their fighter cards are never modified by any in-game actions. However, Gang Fighters taken Out of Action by a Wild Fighter make permanent injury rolls as usual.
- If a specific fighter is the objective for the scenario (such as the Uphiver in the Escort Mission scenario) Wild Fighters **may not** make any attacks that directly target that fighter. Any templates placed over that fighter automatically miss, as do stray shots. The "Objective Fighter" may, howerver, target Wild Fighters with attacks - if they become Engaged, the Wild Fighter may make Retaliation Attacks or perform Fight actions against that Fighter for as long as they remain engaged. The Wild Fighter is not required to **Retreat** from these engagements, but they may not Engage that fighter with their own actions.

> Except where otherwise specified, Wild Fighters act like any other fighter. They still make ammo checks when shooting, they may be subject to conditions like Insane or Broken, etc.
