# Territories

Most battles are fought over Territories. The Victor of these battles gains control over the territory. Control of a Territory grants the controller Boons, usually collected during the End of Week, but sometimes during battles or other phases. Unless otherwise noted, assume a Boon can only be collected during the "Collect Territory Resources" step of the End of Week sequence.

A territory may have an **Enhanced boon** when controlled by a certain **House.** This is marked by parenthesis in the Territory name. Unless otherwise noted, an Enhanced Boon is *in addition* to any standard Boons.

Territories may be freely traded among players - for example, a player may agree to trade a Territory they control for a fighter another player holds captive, or a sum of Credits. During the Takeover phase of the campaign, the Knife may select another player's Territory as the stake for a battle, instead of one of the drawn Territories.

While losing a Territory means a player can no longer collect the associated Boons, unless otherwise noted, any Boons already collected remain with the player.

>For example, if a player upgrades two weapons with the **Archaeotech Device** then loses it to another player during the Takeover phase, their weapons do not lose the upgrade (these weapons may still be lost if the fighter using them dies and their equipment cannot be collected).

# Territory List

These are the Territories available in the Campaign. They are based off the territories that are part of the standard Dominion campaign, but some incorporate changes for balancing purposes or to make them fit in better with the Knifebuckets campaign. Some are entirely new, created for this campaign.

In our game, we had custom Territory cards made by a professional company. If there are any discrepancies between the rules on the physical card and the rules here, these rules supercede those written on the Card.


# ARCHAEOTECH DEVICE (VAN SAAR)

These are relics from a long lost age, when the hive had not yet grown into the sky. They possess strange capabilities, wondrous power and terrible danger in equal measure.
### BOON
**Special:** Each week, one weapon owned by the gang may be given one of the following traits for free: Blaze, Rad-phage, Seismic, or Shock. This weapon also gains the Unstable trait. While only one weapon may be modified per week, there is no limit to the total number of weapons that may be upgraded in this way. These upgrades are permanent.
### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** A Van Saar gang adds +2 to its Reputation each week when it controls this territory.

**Special:** Same as above, except a Van Saar gang may upgrade two weapons per week.

# BONE SHRINE (CAWDOR)
Shrines of bones and noose-ropes are common in the Underhive, and even the most cold-blooded ganger will rarely pass one without throwing in a cred as a plea for a blessing.
### BOON
**Income:** The gang earns 2D6x5 credits from this Territory when collecting income.
### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** A Cawdor gang adds +2 to its Reputation each week when it controls this territory.

**Income:** The gang earns an additional 2D6x5 credits from this Territory when collecting income.

# COLLAPSED DOME
Many of the ancient domes that honeycomb the Underhive eventually collapse under the weight of time, leaving treasures trapped beneath the wreckage and the structure above liable to fall apart at the smallest missstep.
### BOON
**Income:** Income collected is between 2 and 8 D6 X 5 - the collecting player chooses the number of dice to roll. However, if three or more dice show the same number, no income is generated and a random fighter from the gang makes two rolls on the Lasting Injury table, applying the worse (higher) result.

# CORPSE FARM (CAWDOR)
Everyone must eat. The corpse farm renders the flesh of the dead into the corpse-starch that feeds the hive.
### BOON
**Income:** The gang earns D6x10 credits for every fighter that died this week.
### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** A Cawdor gang adds +1 to its Reputation each week it controls this territory.

**Income:** Same as above, but the gang earns 2D6x10 per dead fighter.

# CYBERTEKNIKAE (VAN SAAR)
This doc has been cast from his lofty position for reasons best left unsaid. He wasn't able to bring much beyond his small army of medicae servitors.
### BOON
**Special:** Once per week, the holder of this card may select one fighter to have a permanent injury "cured" via bionics for free.

**Special:** Bionics purchased from the marketplace may be installed on any fighter, even if they don't have a corresponding permanent injury.

Bionics installed via Cyberteknikae immediately put the fighter into Recovery.
### ENHANCED BOON
**Special:** The weekly free bionic may be installed on any fighter, even if they don't have a corresponding permanent injury.

# DRINKING HOLE (DELAQUE)
Reeks of liquor, sweat, and blood. Drown your sorrows or find the courage to confront them.
### BOON
**Income:** The gang receives D6x10 credits each week it controls this territory.

**Reputation:** The gang adds +1 to its Reputation each week it controls this territory.

**Special:** Any fighter in the gang may re-roll any failed Cool check while in combat. If a fighter does this, roll an additional D6: on a 1 or 2, place an Intoxicated marker on that fighter. The marked fighter suffers a -1 to hit for the rest of the battle.

### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** A Delaque gang adds an additional +1 to its Reputation each week.

**Special:** A Delaque gang may not use any of the standard boons. Instead, at the start of any battle, a Delaque gang may randomly select 2 enemy fighters and place an Intoxicated marker on them. The marked fighters suffer -1 to hit for the duration of the battle.

# FIGHTING PIT (GOLIATH)
Violence is life, death, and entertainment in the Underhive. Some of the most feared fighters are made on the cinder floors of fighting pits under the eyes of baying crowds.
### BOON
Bloody Training: Each week, the gang may select up to two fighters and give each an advancement without paying any XP. After completing the Advancement, roll an Injury Dice:

| Dice | Outcome |

|Out of Action | you must make a Permanent Injury roll for that fighter. |
|Serious Injury | The fighter goes into Recovery |
|Flesh wound | No effect |

### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** A Goliath gang adds +2 to its Reputation each week it controls this territory.

# GAMBLING DEN (DELAQUE)
Gambling is rife in the Underhive. Fortunes are won on the turn of a card and lost on the spin of a bolt shell. Only a fool takes house credit.
### BOON
**Reputation:** The gang adds +1 to its Reputation each week it controls this territory.

**Income:** The player declares a number between 1 and 6 then rolls 2d6. If either dice shows the number they declared, or both dice show the same value (regardless of declared number). they earn 10X the number rolled. If both dice show the number they declared, their earnings are doubled. However, if both dice show a 1, they earn nothing from this territory, and their entire earnings for the week (from all other territories!) go to a randomly selected player.
### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** A Delaque gang gains an additional +1 Reputation each week it controls this territory.

**Special:** The Delaque player that controls this Territory may select a single enemy fighter at the start of a battle. That fighter has had their debt called in - they have agreed not to take part in this battle in exchange for keeping all their limbs in place. The fighter is removed from from the battle.

# GENERATORIUM (VAN SAAR)
Much of the light and power in the Underhive relies on taps into energy conduits or barely functioning generators. Those that control those power sources can let it flow... or cut it off at a whim.
### BOON
**Special:** If a gang controls this Territory, a player may choose to stall the generators in battle, terporarily cutting the power to the area and plunging it into darkness. Once per battle, the player may declare they will do this at the beginning of any Priority phase, before the roll for Priority.

For the remainder of the battle, the **Pitch Black rules** are in effect. However, at the start of each End phase, there is a chance that the generators will automatically restart. At the start of each End phase, the player that controls this Territory rolls a D6. If the result is a 5 or more, the generators restart and the Pitch Black rules immediately cease to be in effect. Otherwise, the generators stay silent.
### ENHANCED BOON:
**Reputation:** A Van Saar gang adds +1 to its Reputation each week it controls this territory.

### BOON
**Income:** The gang earns D6x10 credits from this Territory when collecting income.

The gang may put their Captives to work, generating an additional D6x10 for each Captive. If they do this, they may not sell, ransom, or injure their Captives during the "Resolve Captives" phase of the End of Week.

If this territory changes hands, all Captives from the gang that originally held this card are transferred to the new gang. If any captives are members of the newly controlling gang, they are freed.
### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** An Orlock gang adds +2 to its Reputation each week it controls this Territory.

### ENHANCED BOON
**Reputation:** An Escher gang adds +1 to its Reputation each week it controls this territory.

**Income:** Instead of the above income, an Escher gang earns D6x10 credits. If the gang also controls a Synth Still, this is increased to 2D6x10 credits.

# NEEDLE WAYS (DELAQUE)
The Needle Ways are the vents, crawl tunnels, and pipes that thread through the mass of the Hive. Those that can navigate them can pass unseen between almost anywhere.
### BOON
**Special:** The gang that controls this territory may **infiltrate** up to three fighters onto the battlefield ahead of any battle. 

Select up to three members of the starting crew: Instead of being set up on the battlefield, they are placed to one side. At the end of the first round, the controlling player selects a point on the ground surface (or lowest traversable level) of the battlefield, that is not visible to enemy fighters nor within 6 inches of any enemy fighters. They then set up each infiltrating fighter within two inches of that point.

If there's any question about the implementation of this rule, treat it as through the three selected fighters have gained the Infiltrate skill for this battle.

**Special:** A Delaque gang may infiltrate two groups of up to three fighters using the method described above. The player must specify which fighters are in which group before the battle starts.

# PROMETHIUM CACHE
Stacks of fuel drums and tanks fill this half-forgotten reach of the Underhive. It's enough to keep a factory running forever - or burn down half the Sump if someone ignores the "No Smoking" sign.
### BOON
**Equipment:** Each week the gang gains one free Incendiary Charge.

**Special:** All fighters in the gang may re-roll Ammo Checks for any weapon with the Blaze trait.

# REFUSE DRIFT (CAWDOR)
Vast agglomerations of refuse gather in areas of the Underhive in drifts that shift like dine in a desert.
### BOON

**SPECIAL:** The gang earns 3D6x5 credits when collecting income, and has no risk of encountering a nasty waste-lurker.

### BOON
**SPECIAL:** The first Medical Escort action at the end of a battle is free. Additional Medical Escort actions have their cost reduced to 1D6x5.

**Equipment:** Once per week, the player may have one Leader or Champion make a **Special Trade** in addition to any other trades.

### BOON
**Income:** The gang earns D6x10 credits from this Territory when collecting income.
### ENHANCED BOON
**Special:** While it controls this Territory, an Orlock gang has Priority in the first round of any battle. Any gang in the campaign may pay the Orlock gang 20 credits to gain the same benefit in a single battle. The Orlock player cannot refuse, and doesn't even need to be participating in the battle. If all players pay for the boon, it has no effect (credits are still spent)

# TUNNELS (ORLOCK)
Tunnels that run through the Hive are the primary ways that people move between locations. Those that control them can move freely and attack where they wish.
### BOON
**Special:** While it controls this Territory, the gang may choose to have up to three fighters (already selected as part of the crew for the battle) deploy via tunnels.

Instead of placing them on the battlefield, they are placed to one side. During deployment, the player sets up two tunnel markers on any map edge on the lowest level of the battlefield. During the Priority phase of each turn, roll a D6. On a 4+, the fighters arrive on the battlefield: place them within 2 inches of the tunnel marker. That turn they may activate as a single group.

### BOON
**Reputation:** An Orlock gang adds +1 to its Reputation each week it controls this Territory.

**Special:** An Orlock gang may deploy up to six fighters via tunnel instead of the usual three.

# WASTES
Tracts of ash, shapeless rubble, and twisted metal structures run through the Underhive, their size waxing and waning with the ages. Most gangs have to pass through a portion of these wastes as they travel between places of more value.
### BOON
**Special:** During the Occupation phase, the gang controlling this Territory always selects the Territory at stake when they participate in a battle, even if they're a Challenger instead of the Knife.

If it's currently the **Takeover** phase, their selection may include any territory controlled by any other player participating in the battle, **with the exception of territories already belonging to the Knife.** Additionally, this boon does **not** apply if the Territory chosen by the Knife already belongs to the owner of this Territory, but they *may* still apply the other Special Boon.

**Special:** During the Takeover phase, if the territory at stake in a battle is one the holder of this Territory controls, make an Intelligence check for the gang leader. If passed, this player may choose to play the Ambush scenario instead of rolling for scenario. They (along with any other Challengers) are the Attacker, the Knife is the Defender.

# WORKSHOP
Underhive workshops tend to be a combination of different scrap yards, festooned with belts of ammo and strewn with the carcasses of machines. The denizens of such places are often strange recluses, who mutter to their machines and create strange totems out of their rusting treasure.
### BOON
**Special:** At the start of a battle, during deployment, the gang that controls this Territory may set up D3+1 ammo caches within 6 inches of their deployment zone.

**Special:** The gang that controls this Territory may reroll any 1s rolled during an Ammo Check. It's a wonder what regular maintenance can do for a weapon.
