# HIRED GUNS

Hired Guns may be hired as additional crew members before any battle during the [Pre-Battle phase](prebattle.md#hiredguns). The pool of available hired guns are set up at the beginning of each [Week](theweek.md#hiredguns).

Hired Guns are only ever hired for a single battle.

# HIRED GUNS IN BATTLE

For the duration of the battle, the Hired Gun are treated as a member of their gang for most purposes, with the following exceptions: 
​
- Hired Guns taken **Out of Action** do not count as Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests, nor may they be selected to make the Bottle test.
- Hired Guns may not be taken captive, nor are they counted when determining if any captives were taken.

After the battle, that Hired Gun's fighter card is returned to the deck of unused Hired Guns. They may not be hired again this week.

When a Hired Gun goes **Out of Action** during a battle, do not make a Lasting Injury roll. Instead, roll an **injury dice.** On an **Out of Action**, that fighter has died - mark this on their Fighter Card. They may never be hired again.

# The Slaughter Sisters: Suzie and Butcher

When you hire one Slaughter Sister, you hire both. Only one of their Credit Costs need to be paid.
If both Sisters Fighter Cards are drawn when putting together the week's Hired Guns, draw one additional Hired Gun for the week.

Suzie and Butcher Slaughter might not look terribly impressive as individuals, but they're capable of staggering feats of teamwork. Those who've seen them in a brawl swear they act as a single mind, with Butcher wrestling targets into place for Suzie to fry with her specially tuned Tempest Welder.

Special abilities:
- **WE STICK TOGETHER:** If both sisters have a Ready Marker when one is activated, the other may activate simultaneously, as though they were performing a Group Activation. They must be within 6 inches or each other OR have line-of-sight.

- **IN TIGHT SPACES:** If one sister is Engaged with a fighter, the other can make ranged non-template/blast attacks on that fighter with no penalties and no risk of hitting her sister. Additionally, the sister making the ranged attack gets +1 to the hit roll. The enemy receives no cover from the engaged sister's model.

- **LORD HELP THE MISTER:** If one sister goes Out of Action, the other improves Attacks, WS and BS by 1 for the rest of the battle. If one sister dies, the other may never be hired again.

# Other Hired Guns

There are no non-standard abilities for the following Hired Guns, see their cards for full details.
## Burnadette

Two knives, a hazard suit, and a flamethrower.

## Katy Parry

Two swords will turn your enemies into a firework of blood.

## Heater Shottentail

One shotgun, four flavors of bullet.

## Scarlett EnSna'ara

Tomorrow is another day to be caught by a web gun.

## Bullseye Lu-Cye

A sniper who's poison will shut them up real good.

# Enforcer Hired Guns

Many Enforcers aren't above making a couple extra bucks where they can. The following Enforcers can be employed as Hired Guns, and should be shuffled into the Hired Gun pool at the start of the week: 
​ 
- Sergeant Gamma
- Sergeant 820
- 32 Fencer
- Ol' Blue Eyes

Enforcers, like other Hired Guns, cost **half their value** to hire.

If an Enforcer is killed in their employment as a Hired Gun, roll a Permanent Injury for them, ignoring any death results. They may not be hired again, but are still deployed as part of the Enforcer gang.

If **multiple gangs** have employed an Enforcer as a Hired Gun, those Enforcers cannot attack each other, nor can they take any actions that could result in harm towards the other Enforcer via blasts or similar. Enforcer Hired Guns ignore other Enforcer Hired Guns for target priority.
​ 
> This means that if one enforcer attacks with a Blast or Template weapon, the marker may not be placed over another Enforcer hired gun. It may, however, be placed such that they could potentially scatter over another Enforcer - you can't plan for everything.
