# Terrain

Terrain can be put together in many different styles. During the pre-battle phase of most Scenarios, you roll to see what style of terrain you'll be playing on.

Different styles of terrain don't just have different geography, but often have special rules associated with them as well.

# Slums

The battlefield is 36" x 36".

Use all available terrain, to make the setting as dense as possible. No special rules.

# Zone Mortalis

The battlefield is 36" x 36".

Create terrain representing cramped tunnels and passageways. You may use any terrain to represent this, but fighters will not be able to climb, so ensure the entire battlefield is accessible, even if only through winding, maze-like paths.

Do not use ladders, stairs, or other vertical-mobility terrain.

**Special Rules:** The entire battlefield is covered with a low ceiling. Fighters may not climb walls.

# Towers

The battlefield is 24" x 24".

Create at least two towers. The main structures should be far enough apart that they cannot easily be jumped between. The towers extend into the air - the lowest level of the terrain represents open air is not walkable.

There should be lots of platforms sticking out from the tower structures. Connect the towers with lots of bridges and platforms.

**Special Rules:** These towers are high in the air, built around ancient spires or lashed to the side of the Hive dome. The lowest level of the terrain represents the open air, and fighters may not be voluntarily moved there. If a fighter finds themselves there (for example by falling), they **Plummet.**

**Plummet:** make an Initiative check. If the fighter passes, they have caught themselves and are climbing back up to rejoin the battle! At the start of the next round, before placing ready markers, place this fighter back on the battlefield at the lowest valid spot nearest to where they fell.

If they fail the check, treat the fighter as going **Out of Action;** if they fell as the direct result of an attack (i.e., they fell because they were pinned by an attack, or attacked by a weapon with Knockback), count the attacking fighter as making them go Out of Action for experience, objective completion, etc.

# Sump Sea

This terrain represents the docks and floating shantytowns built over the Sump Sea. The Sea is represented by the ground level of the map.

Put it together like Slums, but keep in mind the bottom-most level of the map is not walkable as usual. Use bridges and walkways to ensure paths through the terrain. Use ladders, stairs, and ramps to provide a path for fallen fighters back to land.

**Special Rules:** When in the Sea, the only action a fighter can take is **Swim.**

**Swim (simple):** Make a Strength check. If failed, the Sea counts as **Difficult Terrain** (movement costs double through Difficult Terrain). Then make a **standard Move (Simple)** action.

The Sump Sea is the liquid industrial runoff of the entire Hive. It's not only super gross, it's super toxic. In the **End Phase** of the round, before rolling Recovery tests, every fighter in the Sea receives one **Flesh Wound,** unless they're wearing Hazard Suit armor.
