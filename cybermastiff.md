# Cyber-Mastiff Adoption Drive 2023

These good boys need a home! Starting in Downtime, any of these Cyber-Mastiffs may be permanently adopted for 100 credits. Each gang gets a chance to adopt at least one, and if multiple gangs wish to adopt the same Cyber-Mastiff, roll off to see who gets it. 
  
They follow the standard Exotic Beast rules: 
- They are treated as Wargear and may only be assigned to a **Leader, Champion, or Specialist.** In any scenario where their fighter is deployed, they may be deployed as well, and do **not** count towards the **Crew Size.**
- They may **not** be freely reassigned in the End of Week like other Wargear. Unless their current owner dies, they may only be reassigned to someone who has been freshly promoted to a Leader, Champion, or Specialist. If their owner **dies** the Exotic Beast may be assigned to any Leader, Champion, or Specialist during the End of Week. If the owner Retires, they take their Beast with them.
- Exotic Beasts always activate with their owner, following **Group Activation** rules.
- Exotic Beasts should always end their activation within 3 inches of their owner. If one ends its activation **more than 3 inches away,** it must pass a Nerve Test or become **Broken.**
- Should an Exotic Beast become **Broken,** it will run to its owner rather than towards cover. When it makes a **Running for Cover (Double)** action, it runs **directly towards its owner**, and its only priority is getting as close as possible to its owner.
- An Exotic Beast that has become Broken **automatically rallies**, losing the Broken condition, if it ends an activation within 3 inches of its owner. It gains no experience for this.
- If the owner is removed from the battlefield for any reason, the Exotic Beast is also removed.
- Exotic Beasts are **not counted** for Bottle Test purposes.
- Exotic Beasts cannot change the Weapons or Wargear on their card, except for bionics to cure Permanent Injuries.
- Exotic Beasts can be taken Captive, and be rescued or sold, although they **cannot** work any Territories.
- Exotic Beasts gain Experience, make Advancements, and suffer Lasting Injuries like any other Ganger. However, they have a **special table of Skills** to select from when advancing. When an Exotic Beast gains a skill through Advancement, you may **choose** which skill it gains - animals only learn the tricks they're taught, after all!
