# END OF WEEK

After all Leads have been resolved and any Captive rescue attempts have been mounted, the week ends. The End of Week is when players collect resources, visit the trading post, and take other actions not usually available during the week.

Steps 1-4 should be done with all players together. The remaining steps can be done individually, except step 7, "Determine Underdogs," which requires all players to announce their gang's value.

 
# 1. COLLECT TERRITORY RESOURCES

Each gang goes through every Territory they control, one at a time, and collects any resources they generate - credits, reputation, fighters, etc.

# 2. DETERMINE "TAXES"

Players owe local Enforcers 1d6x4 for each territory they control, excepting their original Settlement. The dice is rolled for the players as a group, once for each "set" of territories.

> For example, after two sessions, Judy has three territories, Steve has two, Emilia has one, and Marco has no territories besides his initial settlement.
>
> First a 4 is rolled, so all players except Marco owe 16 credits to the Enforcers for their first territory. A 3 is rolled for the second set of territories, so Steve and Judy, having a second territory, each owe an additional 12 credits. A 6 is rolled for the third set of territories, so Judy, being the only player with three territories, owes an additional 24 credits for her final territory.

"Taxes" may be paid immediately, or players may wait until step 6.

"Taxes" are cumulative. If a player begins an End of Week with unpaid Debt, add any new "taxes" to their existing debt.

# 3. BID ON TACTICS

Shuffle the pool of Generic tactics cards. Draw a number of these cards equal to the total number of players plus 1.

Starting with the first card drawn, players bid to purchase the cards, with a minimum bid of 5 credits and a minimum increment of 5. The high bidder removes the bid amount from their stash credits, and adds the card to their pool of Tactics cards. 

If no one bids on a card, it is added back to the pool of Generic tactics cards. If there are no Generic cards remaining in the pool, skip this step.

# 4. RESOLVE CAPTIVES

Any gang with Captives may either return them (charging an optional ransom), sell them to the Guilders, or keep them around another week, as long as the Captive's gang has had a chance to rescue the fighter.

If the captor wishes to ransom the fighter, they may negotiate a price with the relevant player. If the other player agrees, they transfer the agreed number of credits from their Stash to the capturing player's, and the fighter (and all its equipment) is returned.

If the captor wishes to sell the fighter to the Guilders, they receive **one quarter** that fighter's credit value, rounded down. Any equipped gear is sold with the fighter - the capturing gang **cannot** separate the equipment from the fighter.

> Gangs may sell their own fighters in this same way, but if they do, they reduce their Leader's LD stat by 3, to a minimum of 12+. Leaders can never be sold - death is the only way for a leader to leave their gang.

## Oh, you wanted *both* eyes? That costs extra 

The captor may inflict one **Lasting Injury** of their choice, selected from the 46-56 rolls on the Lasting Injury table, **before** returning the fighter but **after** the captive's player has had a chance to play the Rescue Scenario. This can be part of the ransom negotiation - "50 credits to get her back, 100 for all her fingers still attached" -  but the ransoming player ***must*** honor their word regarding the condition they say they'll return the fighter in!

If the captor wishes to keep their captive, they may **either** inflict one Lasting Injuryon the prisoner, **or** put the captive to work on a Territory that captives can be worked on (for example, the Mine Workings). They may **not** do both - an injured captive isn't very productive! Either way, for keeping the captive the captor's gang gains 3 reputation, and the captive's gang will have another opportunity to rescue at the end of the next week.

Returned captives are always immediately available for the next battle. They will not go into recovery.

## Arrests

Any fighters arrested by the Enforcers will need to be bailed out at a cost of 40 credits each. This is **separate** from any Debt owed to the Enforcers. If a player does not bail out all their fighters, roll an injury dice for each fighter left in captivity:

| Result | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Out of Action | The fighter is lost forever, having died or gone mysteriously missing while in jail (likely sold to the Guilders by an Enforcer looking to score some quick cash). |
| Serious Injury | Roll 1D6. This is the second dice in a D66 roll, the first is an automatic 5. Look up the corresponding result on the Serious Injury table, and apply this Lasting Injury to the fighter. |
| Flesh Wound | The fighter manages to survive unscathed for another week. |


The remaining End of Week steps may be done individually any time before the next gaming session.

# 5. FIGHTER ADVANCEMENTS :id=advancements

All fighters with sufficient XP may make one or more **Advancements,** increasing their skills, value, and possibly earning a promotion. See Fighter Advancements for details.
 
# 6. BUY AND RE-EQUIP :id=buy

Players may use credits from their Stash to purchase any number of Common items from the trading post, or items from their House List. Players may also recruit any number of Juves or Gangers at the regular price.

Additionally, each Leader, Champion, Specialist, and Juve in a gang may make **one** Trade action per week.

Finally, players may [Retire](gangs.md#retire) any fighters they no longer wish to be part of their gang, either by paying a pension or permanently reducing their leader's **Ld** stat.

## Trade Action

First, choose whether the fighter will look for a **Rare item**, or an **Illegal item.** You may not change the trade type after rolling. 

Calculate the **Trade Score** for this Trade: First Roll 2D6. Add the following bonus based on the selected fighter's type:

| Rank | Modifier |
|---|---|
| Leader | +3 |
| Champion | +2 |
| Specialist | +0 |
| Juve | -1 |

If this is a **Rare trade, add (6 - INT).** If this is an **Illegal trade, add (6 - CL).** Finally, add the gang's **Reputation divided by 5, rounding up.** Note that these can result in adding a negative number, e.g. subtracting from the roll!

The fighter may purchase **one** item of a Rarity/Legality (depending on trade type) equal to or less than the Trade Score, to be added to the gang's stash.

> For example, a Goliath Champion wishes to make an Illegal Trade. He rolls 8 on 2D6, then adds 2 for being a Champion for a total score of 10.
>
> Because this is an Illegal Trade, he adds (6 - Cool). His cool is 5, so he adds (6 - 5), for a new score of 11.  
>
> Finally, his gang has 6 reputation. 6 / 5 = 1.2, rounding up to 2. Adding this to the score gives a final **Illegal Trade Score** of **13**.
>
> This means this Champion can purchase any item from the Trading Post with an Illegal rating of 13 or less. He cannot purchase any Rare items.
>
> If this Goliath Champion were to instead make a **Rare trade**, he would have used his Int stat instead of his Cool stat. With an Int of 8, he would have added (6 - 8), or -2, to the result. This would have resulted in a Rare Trade Score of 10, allowing him to purchase one item with a Rarity of 10 or less, but no Illegal items.

>Bear in mind that there are few Rare items with a rarity of 6 or less, and few Illegal items with an Illegality of 8 or less. If the Trade Score is less than these numbers, this action may not do anything.

Additionally, during this step Players may change the equipment of any of their fighters (except those held captive by another gang or in jail) as they see fit, trading gear between fighters and moving gear in and out of the stash. Usual weapon restrictions apply - each fighter only has three "slots" for weapons, and many weapons take up two slots.

# 6. PAY "TAXES"
If players did not pay on a previous step now, this is their last chance to do so.

If players cannot, or do not wish to, pay the Enforcers, they're in **debt!** Make a note of this on those player's rosters. During their next battle, [the Enforcers](enforcers.md) may stop by to teach them a lesson...


# 7. DETERMINE UNDERDOGS

Clear any existing Underdog statuses.

If any player has any unplayed Underdog tactics cards, return them to the pool of Underdog cards.

Every player determines their Gang Rating by adding together the value of every fighter (with equipment) on their roster, including those in recovery or captivity. Add to this any unspent Credits and unused equipment in the gang's Stash: this is the gang's **Underdog Score**. The highest Underdog score is the **Top Score**.

If any gang's Underdog score is more than 150 credits lower than the Top score, that gang receives the Underdog 1 status. If their score is more than 300 credits lower, they receive the Underdog 2 status. For every additional 100 credit difference, add 1 to the Underdog status. Refer to this table:

| Difference from Top Score | Underdog Status |
|---|---|
| 150 | 1 |
| 300 | 2 |
| 400 | 3 |
| 500 | 4 |
| 600 | 5 |

Shuffle the Underdog Tactics cards. Any player with the Underdog (X) status draws a number of Underdog cards equal to the number in their Underdog status. These cards will be part of their Tactics hand in every battle, in addition to any cards drawn in the usual fashion. Once an Underdog card is played, it's returned to the general pool of Underdog cards, and **cannot be used again** unless drawn at the end of another week.

If you are not using Tactics cards, any player with the Underdog status may hire any Hired Gun (regardless of the Underdog number or Hired Gun cost) for free during the next week.

# 8. Create Tactics Deck

Players take their entire pool of tactics cards - those specific to their House, and generic Tactics cards obtained through bidding - and select 6 or more cards from that to create their Tactics Deck. Before most scenarios, players will draw 2 cards from this deck to use over the course of the battle.

Cards not selected to be part of the Deck are put aside. They cannot be used as Tactics Cards this week.

# NEW WEEK

Once all End of Week actions have happened, a new week begins!
